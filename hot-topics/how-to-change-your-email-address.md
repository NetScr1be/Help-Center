# How to change your Email Address

## Background

In Xumm, we **do not** gather or store any person information about you or your account. (This includes email). If you are interested, you can view our Privacy police here:

[XRPL Labs Privacy Statement](https://xrpl-labs.com/static/documents/XRPL-Labs-Privacy-Statement-V1.pdf)

Having said this, there are a couple of places where email can be stored...

### **Xumm Pro - Early Access**&#x20;

If you have subscribed to **Xumm Pro**, you have the option to enter an email address if you would like to participate in our beta testing program. You can change your email address by launching Xumm Pro, then choosing **Xumm App early access**.&#x20;

### **Xumm Pro - Onramp / Offramp**&#x20;

If you have an account via our On/Off-Ramp service, you would have entered an email address as part of the on boarding process. As a regulated company, we need to store all information (including email addresses) for compliance reasons, but we can add an additional email address to your file of you like.

Simply open a ticket using the [Xumm Support xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support?ref=helpcenter) and ask to have your email address for your On/Off-Ramp account updated. (Don't forget to include your new email address in the message.)&#x20;

### **3rd Party xApps**&#x20;

As we continue to expand the XRPL ecosystem, you will notice more and more partnerships with 3rd party companies such as Banxa, BTC Direct, Gatehub, Stably, etc.

Each company collects and maintains their own records so in order to change your email address with them, you are going to need to contact them directly.
