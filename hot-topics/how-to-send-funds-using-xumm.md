# How to Send Funds Using Xumm

### I**ntroduction**

If you are new to Xumm, it can be a little bit confusing to understand what all the buttons and features do. Trust us when we say, it does get easier after a little bit of practice! ðŸ˜‰

This article talks about how to send funds using Xumm

### **Background**

The first thing to know is that all tokens issued on the XRP Ledger use the same r-address to send and receive as XRP does.

For example, if you want send XRP to your account, you would send it to your r-address. In Xumm you can find your r-address here:

Now, letâ€™s say you want to send another token to your account, for example, CasinoCoin (CSC), you would send it to the same r-address as you would if you were sending XRP. (In this case, **rAtLaNtiSod5cBiw4vjqtoPBLEbXNg**.)

â€¦and if you wanted to send a different token to your account, maybe, Sologenic (SOLO) or Coreum (CORE) or Elysium (ELS), they would all use the same r-address. (Again, in this case, **rAtLaNtiSod5cBiw4vjqtoPBLEbXNg**.)

In all of the above cases, the relevant Trust Line needs to be set before the token will show as an asset in the destination account.

Here is how to create a Trust Line:

### **Each Trust Line has its own r-addressâ€¦**

In order to receive and hold a particular XRP Ledger token, (there are over 82010 of them), you need to create a Trust Line to their project.

Letâ€™s look at the CasinoCoin (CSC) project for example.

The CasinoCoin project issued the CSC token back in March of 2021 from this r-address:

**rCSCManTZ8ME9EoLrSHHYKW8PPwWMgkwr**

If you would like to own CSC tokens, you will need to create a Trust Line to their issuing account. When you create a Trust Line, you are basically saying that you have researched their project and are satisfied that they are a trustworthy company.

### **Sending funds using Xumm**

Now that you know where to send your assets to and you know a bit about how Trust Lines work, you are ready to use Xumm to send funds.

#### **Step 1**

From the main screen in Xumm, press the **Send** button.

On the following screen, you will see the option to enter the **amount** you would like to send.

(You can also change the account you would like to send the tokens **from** and you can change the **type** of token you would like to send.)

In our case, we are going to send 1 XRP from our account (**rAtLaNtiSod5cBiw4vjqtoPBLEbXNg**)

Press the **Next** button to continue.

**Step 2**

In this screen you can enter the **destination account** that you are sending your tokens to.

Keep in mind, there are two types of accounts on the XRPL.

* Non custodial accounts - You are solely responsible for managing your private keys.
* Custodial accounts - A company is responsible for the private keys to your account. (Usually a crypto exchange.)

Both types of accounts will have an r-address but a custodial account will also require a destination tag. (More about destination tags later.)

Press **Next** after you have entered/selected the correct destination r-address.

**Step 3**

Finally we reach the **Summary** screen. Here you can review your transaction to make sure it is correct.

This is also where you would enter you your **destination tag** if you are sending to a custodial account.

#### If you are sending to a non-custodial account, you can **Slide to send** your transaction.

#### If you are sending to a custodial account, make sure you enter your destination tag before you **Slide to send**.

#### **A little bit more about destination tags**

You may have noticed that most crypto exchanges have **one** receiving r-address for **all** of their XRP customers? Have you ever wondered how thousands of customers can use just one XRP account? How is this possible? The answer is called destination tags, which are a set numeric numbers that you enter into an XRPL transaction to identify a specific account at an exchange.
