If you are sending to a non-custodial account, you can simply **Slide to send** and your transaction will be sent to the XRP Ledger to process.

However, if you are sending to a **custodial** account, (ie. an exchange account) this where you would enter your **destination tag**.

Remember, non-custodial accounts, like the ones managed with Xumm **do not** require destination tags. Only **custodial** accounts require them.
