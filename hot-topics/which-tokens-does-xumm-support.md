# Which tokens does Xumm support?

## Which tokens does Xumm support?

**Summary**

* Xumm is exclusively an XRP Ledger wallet.
* We support XRP and the 8200+ tokens issued on the XRPL.
* As long as the token was issued on the XRP Ledger, Xumm supports it.

### **Which ones are you affiliated with and which ones do you endorse?**

_Xumm is **not** affiliated with any token on the XRPL and we **do not** endorse any of them._

By “support” we mean that you can use Xumm to interact with any token issued on the XRPL. We support all transaction types and you can use the DEX Trade xApp in Xumm to buy and sell any XRPL token via the XRPL DEX.

We **do not** provide technical support for any specific token or project. Each individual token issuer provides support for their own token.

### **Why doesn’t Xumm support other blockchains?**

While there are other blockchain technologies that might show promise or potential,  we are committed developing the XRPL ecosystem. To do this correctly, it requires focus, a great team of professionals and the perseverance to endure the ups and downs associated with emerging technologies.

We feel that diverting our focus or becoming a “jack of all trades” wallet, would not benefit the XRP Community. The XRPL is our passion and our specialty. Why would we want to mess with that?

### **Do you plan to support other blockchains?**

No. Our focus is the XRP Ledger.

### **… But there I see BTC, ETH, SGB, FLR, USD, etc. tokens on the XRPL. How does that make sense?**

Anyone can create a token on the XRP Ledger. (Xumm actually contains an xApp called _**Token Creator**_ to walk you through the process.)

For example, a BTC token on the XRP Ledger is not the same as the native BTC mined on the Bitcoin blockchain.

You can not send BTC issued on the XRPL to the Bitcoin network and you can not send BTC from the Bitcoin network to the XRPL.

The XRP Ledger and the Bitcoin blockchain are separate and incompatible networks.

### **So can I send ETH to the XRPL?**

No. ETH is the native token on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **What about XLM?**

No. XLM is the native token on the Stellar blockchain. The Stellar blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **SGB?**

No. SGB is the native token on the Songbird blockchain. The Songbird blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **How about XDC?**

No. XDC is the native token on the XinFin blockchain. The XinFin blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **Where can I see a list of the tokens that you support?**
