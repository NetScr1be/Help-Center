# Deposit to Exchange Didn’t Arrive

## What to do When a Deposit to an Exchange Didn’t Arrive

#### **Situation**

You sent XRP to your crypto exchange account and it has not arrived.

#### **General information**

In order to send XRP into an exchange account, you need to know **two** pieces of information:

1. the correct exchange r-address to send the funds to
2. the destination tag (some exchanges incorrectly call the destination tag a “memo”) for your exchange account

Both of these are provided by your crypto exchange.

If you are unsure what a destination tag is, you can watch this video for more information:

* [Destination Tags (Explainer video 5/5)](https://support.xumm.app/hc/en-us/articles/4408087987346)

or for a more detailed, you can read this article: [Introduction to Destination Tags](https://support.xumm.app/hc/en-us/articles/360018134720-An-introduction-to-Destination-Tags)

#### **Why a deposit might not arrive**

The first thing to check in Xumm is the **Events** list. You should confirm that transaction completed and is listed in the event log.

As well, make sure the destination tag was entered **correctly**.

This is the **number 1 reason** funds are not delivered. People either don’t enter a destination tag or enter a destination tag incorrectly.

If the destination r-address and tag are both correct and the funds still have not arrived in your exchange account, it is most likely that your exchange has not processed that transaction on their side perhaps due to technical issues, a processing backlog, or because they are holding your funds for KYC/AML reasons.

#### **What you can do to retrieve your funds**

Once Xumm submits a transaction to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for processing, there is nothing that can be done to change or reverse it. This article explains how this works:

* [Can Xumm reverse, freeze or undo a transaction?](https://support.xumm.app/hc/en-us/articles/4735501871122)

All crypto exchanges have a process that needs to be followed in order to investigate a transaction.

Start by contacting your exchange and explain what happened. They should provide you with the step by step instructions on how begin the process and what information they require. They will also inform you of any fees that they might charge in order to recover your funds.

(Note: Any fees an exchange charges has nothing to do with Xumm or the the XRP Ledger. Each exchange determines their own service fees.)

To confirm, you should **contact your exchange** and they will work with you to determine what happened to your funds.
