# Push notifications

Push notifications are small, pop-up messages that Xumm will display on your phone to alert you of various transactions on your XRP Ledger account. Push notifications convery real-time transactional messages, updates, support messages and more, all of which will help keep you up-to-date on account.

### _Frequently asked Questions_

#### What are some of the push  notifications I will receive?

Here is an example from a typical phone running Android:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/push notification - 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Notice the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the image and the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> on the Xumm icon. These are indicators that there has been some activity on your account.

If you tap the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt="" data-size="line"> you can view the details of the activity.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/push notification - 1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this case you can see that a payment of .000001 XRP was received in the XRPL account labelled "Will".

#### Where can I find this in Pro?
