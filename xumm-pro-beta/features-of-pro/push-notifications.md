# Push notifications

Push notifications are small, pop-up messages that Xumm will display on your phone to alert you of various transactions on your XRP Ledger account. Push notifications convery real-time transactional messages, updates, support messages and more, all of which will help keep you up-to-date on account.

### _Frequently asked Questions_

#### What are some of the push  notifications I will receive?

Here is an example from a typical phone running Android:

Notice the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the image and the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (4) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> on the Xumm icon. These are indicators that there has been some activity on your account.

If you tap the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt="" data-size="line"> you can view the details of the activity. Here are a couple examples of push notifications sent by Xumm:

In the first example, you can see that a payment of .000001 XRP was received in the XRPL account labelled "Will" and in the second example you can see that the Xumm Support team has replied to a ticket created via the [Xumm Support xApp](../../all-about-xapps/xumm-xapps/xumm-support.md).

#### Where can I find this in Pro?
