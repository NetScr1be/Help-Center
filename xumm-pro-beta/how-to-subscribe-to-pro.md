### Understanding the process

In case you're interested, we originally had two different purchase flows in Xumm. (One for Xumm Pro and one for our hardware wallets, (Xumm cards)) The thing is, Xumm Pro always comes with 2 Xumm cards and when you purchase Xumm cards, they always come with a Pro subscription, so why have two separate flows when one will do?&#x20;

So you'll notice that the subscription process takes you through the Xumm card purchase flow. This is how it was designed to work.&#x20;

### **How to subscribe**

1\) You can order the cards from the [Get cards xApp](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.tangem-order) from within Xumm or by launching Xumm, pressing the **xApps** button (on the bottom of the main screen) then choosing **Get cards**.

3\) Chose the number of cards you would like to receive along with your Pro subscription. Most people go with the **2x Card** option, but you choose 2,3,4 or 5 depending on your needs.&#x20;

4\) Scroll down and decide whether you would like to purchase XRP with your order.

Note: If you like, you can buy enough XRP to cover the account reserve for one of your new card accounts along with additional XRP for saving/spending. &#x20;

5\) Choose which country you would like the cards sent to by tapping the down arrow in the **Shipping options** section, then choose _Standard_ or _Express_ delivery. When done press the **Continue to Payment** button.

6\) Choose how you would like to pay for your cards and Pro subscription.

If you are not going to purchase additional XRP, paying with Xumm (in XRP) is quick, easy and will save you money.

If you are purchasing additional XRP, you are going to choose to pay with a Credit Card.

Note: A 16% premium applies)

Just fill out the form and your credit card information and tap the **Pay** button.

Note: If you pay with XRP, you will receive instant access to Pro. No waiting. No hassle.

If you pay with a credit card, you will receive your Pro activation email when **the cards ship from our office**. This normally happens the next business day, but depending on the volume of orders, it might take two business days before the cards ship and you receive your activation email.
