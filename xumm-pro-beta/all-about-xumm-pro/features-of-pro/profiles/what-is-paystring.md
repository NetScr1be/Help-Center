# What is PayString?

### What is PayString?

Put simply, PayString is like a phone book for the XRP Ledger. It is a protocol that maps human-readable addresses to their corresponding payment addresses.

### What problem does PayString solve?

The public address on the XRP Ledger is a string of numbers and letters called an **r-address**.

For example:

rGCEB4TQDkdU6GLjc5py15yT1ksrGqPebK

Due to their complexity, r-addresses can be difficult to remember. PayString solves this issue by mapping an r-address to an easy-to remember address.&#x20;

### Which networks support PayString?

Currently, only the XRP Ledger supports the PayString protocol.

### How does the Paystring ID work in Xumm?

PayString is part of the Profiles feature in Xumm Pro.

More information about about Profiles (and how it works) please refer to this article:
