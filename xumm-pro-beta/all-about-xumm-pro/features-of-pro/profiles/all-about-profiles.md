# All about Profiles

### **What exactly is Profiles?**

Profiles is basically an easy way to identify yourself on the XRP Ledger blockchain. It allows you to create and publish an identity profile page so other people can identify who you are.&#x20;

Here’s what a Profile page looks like:

### **Why would I want to create a public Profile on the XRPL?**

There are a couple of reasons you might want to do this.

* The XRP Ledger community is made up of people from all over the world. In most societies, people prefer to know who they are dealing with when it comes to matters of finance and financial payments. Creating a public profile is a good way add **trust** between Xumm users.
* As governments around the world move closer towards regulating public blockchains, creating a verified public profile is a safe and secure way to add **transparency** to the XRPL and stay ahead of the coming regulations.
* It is a pretty cool way to represent yourself and it allows you to control your imagine in the XRPL community. You get your own personal page on the internet which provides an easy way for people to send you funds. As well, future updates to Profiles will also include "Xumm badges" for achievements such as Contributor, Validator, Beta Tester, Supporter and many more..

### **How do I access my Profile page?**

You just need to open your favorite internet browser and enter your Profile page address.

To get to Kevin's page, you would enter:&#x20;

The next step is to create a “user ID” known as a _slug_ which closely matches the verified ID provided during the KYC process. You can choose your own slug, but it must be similar to what is on your government issued ID.

Your profile page can be accessed by anyone who knows your profile slug.
