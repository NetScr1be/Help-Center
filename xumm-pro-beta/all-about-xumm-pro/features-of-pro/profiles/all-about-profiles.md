# All about Profiles

### **What exactly is Profiles?**

Profiles is basically an easy way to identify yourself on the XRP Ledger blockchain. It allows you to create and publish an identity profile page so other people can identify who you are.&#x20;

Hereâ€™s what a Profile page for one of our developers, Kevin:

### **Why would I want to create a public Profile on the XRPL?**

There are a couple of reasons you might want to do this.

* The XRP Ledger community is made up of people from all over the world. In most societies, people prefer to know who they are dealing with when it comes to matters of finance and financial payments. Creating a public profile is a good way add **trust** between Xumm users.
* As governments around the world move closer towards regulating public blockchains, creating a verified public profile is a safe and secure way to add **transparency** to the XRPL and stay ahead of the coming regulations.
* It is a pretty cool way to represent yourself and it allows you to control your imagine in the XRPL community. You get your own personal page on the internet which provides an easy way for people to send you funds. As well, future updates to Profiles will also include "Xumm badges" for achievements such as Contributor, Validator, Beta Tester, Supporter and many more..

### **How do I access my Profile page?**

You just need to open your favorite internet browser and enter your Profile page address.

For example, to get to Kevin's page, you would enter:&#x20;

[xumm.me/kevin](https://xumm.me/kevin)

In your case, your Profile page would match your identity much closer than Kevin's test page. So if your name is John Shepard, your Profile page could be:

<mark style="color:blue;">xumm.me/johnshepard</mark>

or if your name is Daniel Jackson, your Profile page could be:

<mark style="color:blue;">xumm.me/danieljackson</mark>

The idea is that your Profile page matches your actual identity.

### What is my Paystring?

Your PayString address is an easy way for people to send you funds on the XRP Ledger.

In Kevin's case, his Paystring is:

kevin$xumm.me

If you wanted to send XRP to Kevin account, you could always enter his r-address: **rUBvs5S....**

but many people have trouble remembering r-addresses. It is much easier to send the XRP to: **kevin$xumm.me**&#x20;

### How can people find my PayString?

Since all Xumm Profile pages start with: **xumm.me/**\<yourname> you could simply tell people how to find your page, or, since all PayStrings end with: \<yourname>**$xumm.me** your could simply tell them your PayString but we have taken it one step further.

In Xumm, you can actually search for people's PayString directly from the Send flow. In this case, we search for "kevin" and Xumm will display the results for you to choose.

It is almost like a phone book, you can look up someone's r-address just by knowing their name!  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
