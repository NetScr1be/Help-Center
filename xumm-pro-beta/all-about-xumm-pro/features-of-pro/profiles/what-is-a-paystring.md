# What is a Paystring?

### What is Paystring?

When referring to Paystring you are typically referring to one of two things:

1\) The payment identifier protocol developed by Ripple that allows you to create a single ID that can be used to send or receive money across all supported networks.

2\) The Paystring ID that is an easily readable identifier allows you to send or receive money on any network that supports the Paystring protocol.

### Which networks support the Paystring protocol?

The XRP Ledger, Bitcoin and Ethereum to name a few...

### Does Xumm support those other networks?

Since Xumm is exclusively an XRP Ledger wallet, it only supports the XRP Ledger.

### How does the Paystring ID work in Xumm?

for all payments. One PayString can represent addresses on any network. At GateHub, a PayString represents an XRPL address.

This means that you will be able to use a PayString to send payments to any network that PayString will support.

&#x20;

When a payment is made to a PayString, the server returns an eligible address (for example, a Bitcoin address for a BTC payment). If no eligible address is found with the PayString, the server will return a notification that the payment channel is not available.

PayString is a payment identifier protocol developed by Ripple and provides a single ID for anyone needing to send or receive money.

PayString is a simple, web-based protocol designed to make it as easy to send someone money as it is to send them an email. With the PayString protocol, you use human-readable addresses to transmit value in the currency of your choice. The PayString network allows participants to reach one another through standardized addresses.

PayString is fully peer-to-peer with no central counterparty.
