# What is a Paystring?

### What is Paystring?

PayString is a payment identifier protocol developed by Ripple and provides a single ID for anyone needing to send or receive money.

PayString is a simple, web-based protocol designed to make it as easy to send someone money as it is to send them an email. With the PayString protocol, you use human-readable addresses to transmit value in the currency of your choice. The PayString network allows participants to reach one another through standardized addresses.

PayString is fully peer-to-peer with no central counterparty.
