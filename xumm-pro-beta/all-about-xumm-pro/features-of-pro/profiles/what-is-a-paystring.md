# What is a PayString?

### What is PayString?

Put simply, PayString is like a phone book for the XRP Ledger. It is a protocol that maps human-readable addresses to their corresponding payment addresses.

### What problem does PayString solve?

The public address on the XRP Ledger is a string of numbers and letters called an **r-address**.

Here is an example:

rGCEB4TQDkdU6GLjc5py15yT1ksrGqPebK

R-addresses can be difficult to remember (due to their complexity) so a standard was developed to map an r-address to an easy-to remember address.&#x20;

### Which networks support PayString?

Currently, only the XRP Ledger supports the PayString protocol.

### How does the Paystring ID work in Xumm?

Here is an example of a Paystring ID: will$xumm.me

{% embed url="https://xumm.me/will" %}

PayString is a simple, web-based protocol designed to make it as easy to send someone money as it is to send them an email. With the PayString protocol, you use human-readable addresses to transmit value in the currency of your choice. The PayString protocol allows participants to reach one another through standardized addresses.

PayString is fully peer-to-peer with no central counterparty.
