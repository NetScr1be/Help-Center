# What is a PayString?

### What is PayString?

Put simply, PayString is like a phone book for the XRP Ledger. It is a protocol that maps human-readable addresses to their corresponding payment addresses.

### What problem does PayString solve?

The public address on the XRP Ledger is a string of numbers and letters called an **r-address**.

For example:

rGCEB4TQDkdU6GLjc5py15yT1ksrGqPebK

Due to their complexity, r-addresses can be difficult to remember. PayString solves this issue by mapping an r-address to an easy-to remember address.&#x20;

### Which networks support PayString?

Currently, only the XRP Ledger supports the PayString protocol.

### How does the Paystring ID work in Xumm?

PayString is part of the Profiles feature in Xumm Pro.
