# üòé What is Xumm Pro?

Xumm Pro is a paid subscription service which provides additional features to the Xumm wallet.&#x20;

Some of these features include:

### **Profiles**

* Claim & personalize your own profile page for payment requests & invoice payment in XRP and IOUs
* Show your name, profile icon & checkmark next to transactions and requests in Xumm and other XRPL ecosystem tools
* Claim your **`xumm.me`** hosted PayString ID for multiple XRP ledger accounts
* Publish your KYC status (not your personal details, just the fact that you successfully went through KYC) so 3rd party apps can unlock features based on your account trustworthiness

### **Push Notifications**

* Receive notifications for incoming transactions

### **Fiat on-boarding**

* Currently available for our users in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, this feature allows you to buy XRP directly from Xumm Pro. (Currently we support EUR deposits only.)

### **KYC**

* This will allow you to go through the KYC process directly in Xumm

### **24 hour Technical Support**

* 24 hour support with quicker response times and in multiple languages.

### **How much does it cost to subscribe to Xumm Pro Beta?**

A subscription to Xumm Pro Beta costs **$60 USD (paid in XRP)** but we are so excited about the beta release, we are offering **1 1/2 years** of Xumm Pro access for the price of a 1 year subscription! üéÅ ü•≥&#x20;

We truly appreciate your early and continued support and value your potential input, so if you subscribe now, you get access to the Pro beta program and your subscription does not officially start until the beta program ends.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind, as the price of XRP fluctuates in relation to USD, you will see that the XRP price of Pro Beta changes to match.
{% endhint %}

### **So I get to use Pro Beta for free until the beta period ends, then I get a 1 1/2 year subscription?**

That is exactly right. If you subscribe now, you can enjoy all of the current features Pro Beta has to offer for free, then, when the beta period ends, your 1 1/2 year subscription starts!

###

### **Is this a one time fee or a yearly subscription?**

While we would love everyone to have Pro features forever & for free, developing software and running a software business takes continued investments. A one time payment would not allow us to sustain development, therefore in order to continue to enjoy the features of Xumm Pro, you can renew your subscription annually‚Ä¶. but don‚Äôt worry, when your subscription is about to end, we will be sure to notify you!

### **Can I order Pro from anywhere in the word?**

You certainly can but please be aware, there are a couple of countries where we **can not** ship the Xumm cards to. These include:

* North Korea
* Iran
* Belarus
* Ukraine
* Vietnam

So while you can subscribe to and enjoy all of the great features of Xumm Pro, unfortunately we will be unable to send you the free Xumm cards.  Reach out to us via the [**Xumm Support xApp**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support) if you have any additional questions about this.

### **Why should I subscribe to Pro beta now and not wait for the ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù version of Xumm Pro?**

Many people have requested access to the features that Pro Beta offers so we have been working night and day developing and refining them. While the Pro Beta features are ready to go, we really want to get your feedback and suggestions on how they work for you. Your input is a critical component in our development process. ü§ó

So if you have any ideas/comments on how we can improve, we would be delighted to hear them. We even have a special site where you can share your suggestions with us:

* [Feedback](https://feedback.xumm.dev/)

Plus, by subscribing now, you get to enjoy all the features of Pro beta for free!

### **When will Xumm Pro Beta ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù to Xumm Pro?**

In a way, Xumm Pro will probably never be ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù. We continue to develop new features and have a bunch of new ideas that we want to add but the beta version will ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù when the core features of Xumm Pro are done and working smoothly. These include:

* Auto finish escrow
* Encrypted backups
* Payment requests

We are very meticulous when it comes to coding Xumm and do not rush our features or product releases. They will be ready when they are ready.

### **I‚Äôm feeling generous! How do I give Pro Beta as a gift?**

You are probably not surprised to hear this, but many people in the XRP community are VERY generous. For those who wish to give a Pro Beta subscription as a gift to someone else, we have created as special page to simplify this process for your you.

{% embed url="https://xrpl-labs.com/gift-pro" %}

This link takes you to a page that looks like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Gift Xumm Pro.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Simply press the **Gift directly to r-address** button, enter the r-address of the lucky person and press the _**Purchase**_ button.

### **Is there a way I can test Xumm Pro to see if I like it?**

Unfortunately not. We do not offer a trial period.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, due to the costs associated with the cards and the KYC process, along with the integration of Profiles into Xumm and the XRP ecosystem, we do not offer refunds on Pro subscriptions, so please make sure you thoroughly review the features before subscribing.
{% endhint %}
