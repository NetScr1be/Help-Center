# ðŸ˜Ž What is Xumm Pro?

Xumm Pro is a paid subscription service which provides additional features to the Xumm wallet.&#x20;

Some of these features include:

#### **Profiles**

* Claim & personalize your own profile (name & slug) for payment requests & invoice payment in XRP and IOUs
* Show your name, profile icon & checkmark next to transactions and requests in Xumm and other XRPL ecosystem tools
* Claim your **`xumm.me`** hosted PayID for multiple XRP ledger accounts
* Publish your KYC status (not your personal details, just the fact that you successfully went through KYC) so 3rd party apps can unlock features based on your account trustworthiness

#### **Push Notifications**

* Receive notifications for incoming transactions

#### **Fiat on/off boarding**

* Currently available for our users in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, this feature allows you to buy XRP direct from Xumm Pro. Stay tuned as we plan to add more countries as the year progresses!

**KYC**

* This will allow you to go through the KYC process directly in Xumm

**24 hour Technical Support**

* 24 hour support with quicker response times and in multiple languages.
