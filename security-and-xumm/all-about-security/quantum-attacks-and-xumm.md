## **Introduction**

This article is meant to answer some basic questions about quantum computing and to explain our view on the future of quantum attacks as they relate to Xumm and the XRP Ledger.

### **What is a quantum computer?**

Theoretically, in the near future, there will be several different types of quantum computers that will be capable of doing certain types computation at very high speeds. Some of those computers will most likely be suitable for analyzing cryptographic algorithms. Those are referred to as CRQC's or “Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers”. CRQCs will theoretically be extremely adept at attacking and deciphering real world cryptographic systems.&#x20;

### **Which cryptographic systems are at risk of being attacked?**

The XRP Ledger uses asymmetric-key algorithms to secure XRPL account. Also referred to as public-key algorithms, asymmetric-key algorithms use paired keys (a public and a private key) in performing their function. The public key is known to all, but the private key is controlled solely by the owner of that key pair. The private key cannot currently be mathematically calculated through the use of the public key even though they are cryptographically related. In theory, CRQC's will be able to calculate the private key based solely on the information contained in the public transactions recorded on the XRPL.&#x20;

### **When will a quantum computer be ready to initiate a quantum attack?**

Some estimates suggest CRQC's will be viable in about 5 years time. One study suggests that a quantum computer possessing about 4000 qubits of processing power could theoretically crack the cryptography used by Bitcoin. Currently, IBM has a machine with just over 400 qubits of processing power.

### How does this apply to the XRP Ledger?

Currently, there is no agreed upon definition of what makes an algorithm quantum resistant.

In theory, a quantum resistant algorithm for the XRP Ledger must be able to:

* resist quantum factoring (See [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's\_algorithm))
* resist quantum searching (See [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover's\_algorithm))
* resist quantum machine learning&#x20;

When such an algorithm is developed, integrating it into the XRPL should be a straight forward process. (Just as the Ed25519 algorithm was added).&#x20;

Keep in mind, any new algorithm that is added to the XRPL will need to be supported forever, so while it is a fairly easily process to add additional algorithms, it is not something to be taken lightly. Ideally, the XRPL community will wait as long as safely possible before adding a new one.

### How does this apply to Xumm?

There is a risk when it comes to "Sign In" signatures that are generated by Xumm. These signatures get generated when signing into a websites and are stored in our database for a short time before being purged. (They don't get applied on chain so they are not publicly accessible.)

In theory we could invest millions of dollars in a CRQC and try to crack your account secret via the Sign in signatures.  (We updated our encryption algorithms to the very latest version (AES-256 GCM) back in v2.4, so they are cutting edge and will updated the moment a quantum resistant one becomes available.)

Needless to say we don't act in bad faith and we don't have access to a quantum computer  - and we purge our database regularly so the signature will be gone soon enough (and never be on chain).

### What can I currently do to protect my assets?

There are currently two options to options to help protect against quantum attacks until quantum resistant algorithms are implemented on the XRPL:

1. Create a new XRPL account and move your assets to your new account then leave it alone. A CRQC will need an outgoing public transaction to analyze the public key of you account. Once you perform any transaction on your new account, it will be vulnerable to a quantum attack.
2. Create a new XRPL account and re-key your existing account to point to your new account then disable your master key on your existing account and leave it alone, Once you perform any transaction on your new re-keyed account, it will be vulnerable to a quantum attack.

### What else is Xumm doing to prepare against quantum attacks?

One of the major projects we have been developing is adding smart contact functionality for the XRP Ledger. We call it, "Hooks".

Theoretically, you can create a Hook to create any signing scheme you desire. For example, you could delegate a transaction through a Hook and ask it to emit it for you which would allow you to change your signing scheme until you were satisfied it was safe.

Another option would be to create a Hook that simply blocks any transaction that doesn't include the additional quantum resistant signature. (Using this type of hook, you wouldn’t even need to re-emit the transaction.)
