# Upgrading your encryption

{% hint style="info" %}
Before we continue, we want to assure you that the whichever version of Xumm that you are currently using is incredibly **safe**. Upgrading your accounts using our new algorithm simply increases the security from extremely secure to "even our security auditors feel we outdid ourselves secure". This process is completely optional and while we recommend that you go through the process, it is not required.&#x20;


{% endhint %}

### A Brief background

All versions of Xumm prior to v2.4 use the AES 256-CBC encryption algorithm to encrypt your secret keys on your phone. It is the same algorithm currently used by banks, large businesses and even governments all over the world and is extremely secure.  The AES 256 is a standard encryption algorithm in the crypto industry and is widely used however...

### Pushing the envelope...

While the AES 256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) still remains the encryption algorithm of choice for governments and financial institutions around the world, it is still decades old and the latest AES 512-GCM algorithm is much more computationally complex. Updating Xumm to this enhanced standard just extends our lead in the crypto space and to be honest, Xumm users have come to expect nothing less than the best. If there was a better way to encrypt your private keys, we would have already implemented it.

### How to upgrade &#x20;

We have made the upgrade process super easy, so if you are ready to upgrade your accounts here are the steps:

Launch Xumm and press **Settings** then **Accounts**:

then press the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png) button.

You may have noticed in our example that the "Card 1" account is not displayed in the above image. The "Card 1" account is a Xumm Tangem card account so it can be upgraded. (Since the private key is stored on the card itself, not in Xumm.)
