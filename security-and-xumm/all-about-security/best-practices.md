### Have at least two XRPL accounts

It is certainly safer to manage your funds using two or more separate accounts. Doing so provides the following benefits:

&#x20;   1\) It limits the potential attack vectors&#x20;

By limiting the location of where you use the card(s), you limit to potential places where someone might be able to intercept a transaction between Xumm and the card via NFC. Your home would theoretically be a more secure location than a shopping mall for example.&#x20;

&#x20;    2\) Having multiple accounts allows you to spread your funds between them

Some people have gone so far as to have multiple Xumm (Tangem) accounts and divide their funds between them. Having your funds spread out in several different accounts, ensures that if someone were to somehow get access to one account, they would not get access to all of your funds. &#x20;

&#x20;    3\) Having a dedicated "spending" account further limits your potential loss in case your account is compromised. A separate spending account that you actively manage helps to keep your "savings account(s)" safe by only exposing it to the world. Your Tangem card(s) remain at home, in a safe environment.&#x20;
