# Common misconceptions about Xumm

When it comes to platforms as powerful as Xumm, it is normal for misinformation to circulate around some of it features and capabilities. Let's see if we can clear some of this up...

### Xumm stores your XRP&#x20;

The native currency of the XRP Ledger is called XRP. XRP exists on the XRPL and can not be moved off of the XRPL so XRP is always "stored" on the XRP Ledger. What Xumm actually stores is the private key to access your XRP Ledger account.&#x20;

### Xumm has access to your funds - It does not.

### Xumm is a custodial wallet - It is not.

### You can't buy XRP using Xumm - You certainly can.

### Xumm is not as safe as a cold wallet

### Xumm offers staking
