# How to use the Tangem backup xApp

Congratulations! If you are reading this you have decided to use the Tangem Backup xApp to create a backup for you XRP Ledger account.

This is a very wise decision! Creating a backup is one of the best ways to keep your crypto safe.

Once you have successfully completed this procedure, you should also consider reviewing this article:

* [Tangem cards - Best Practices](https://support.xumm.app/hc/en-us/articles/4416929335186)

It discusses other recommended procedures to help protect your funds.

### **Understanding the process before you get started**

The Tangem Backup xApp is designed to simplify the process of creating a regular key between two Xumm (Tangem) cards. By doing this, you will effectively have configured one of the cards as a "backup" to the other one. This is not a cloning process where you would make a duplicate a card, it is about configuring one of the cards to be able to sign transactions on the other card's account.

It can be tricky to understand at first but this article will walk you through each step of the process and provide example to help you better understand what is actually happening.

### What we are trying to achieve...

If you are reading this you probably have two Xumm (Tangem) cards and are wondering to get started using them.

First off, the two cards appear differently.









band make it easy you need two things:

1. An account on the XRP Ledger that is currently imported into XUMM and has been activated with at least 10 XRP. It can be another card account or a non-card account. Either one will work.
2. A XUMM Tangem card that that has been imported into XUMM.

For most people, they will choose to use two Tangem cards to do this procedure.

While we have tried to make this procedure as easy as possible, we find that the single, biggest difficulty people make is that they do not import their two cards into Xumm before beginning the process. This is a critical step! If you are going to create a backup, **both cards have to be imported into XUMM.**&#x20;

As well, one of the cards need to be activated with 10 XRP. The 2nd card does NOT need to be activated.
