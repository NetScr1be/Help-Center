# How to use the Tangem backup xApp

Congratulations! If you are reading this you have decided to use the Tangem Backup xApp to create a backup for you XRP Ledger account.

This is a very wise decision! Creating a backup is one of the best ways to keep your crypto safe.

Once you have successfully completed this procedure, you should also consider reviewing this article:

* [Tangem cards - Best Practices](https://support.xumm.app/hc/en-us/articles/4416929335186)

It discusses other recommended procedures to help protect your funds.

### **Understanding the process before you get started**

The Tangem Backup xApp is designed to simplify the process of creating a regular key between two Xumm (Tangem) cards. By doing this, you will effectively have configured one of the cards as a "backup" to the other one. This is not a cloning process where you would make a duplicate a card, it is about configuring one of the cards to be able to sign transactions on the other card's account.

It can be tricky to understand at first but this article will walk you through each step of the process and provide example to help you better understand what is actually happening.

### What we are trying to achieve...

If you are reading this you probably have two Xumm (Tangem) cards and are wondering to get started using them.

First off, the two cards appear differently.

They are identical in every way other than their appearance.

From now on we will refer to the cards your **Primary card** and your **Signing Card**. You can choose either card which one is which, but most people choose the _blue_ card as the Primary card and the _transparent_ card as the Signing card.

When we are done with this process,

* &#x20;you will put the Primary card in a safe place&#x20;
* you will use the Signing card to sign transactions. If you plan to carry a card with you in your wallet/purse, this is the card you will carry.
