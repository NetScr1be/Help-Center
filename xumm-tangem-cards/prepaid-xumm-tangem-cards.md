# Prepaid Xumm (Tangem) cards

\<This article is still under construction>

Let's face it, when it comes to getting started on the XRP Ledger, it can be a little bit complicated if you don't know what you're doing.  We've create articles to try to make the process as easy as possible...

* [How to create an XRPL account](../getting-started-with-xumm/your-first-xrp-ledger-account/how-to-create-an-xrpl-account.md)
* [Activating an XRPL account](../getting-started/how-to-activate-a-new-xrpl-account.md)

...but we thought to ourselves, what if we could make it even easier? What if we could make it so people would just have to purchase a Xumm (Tangem) card and it would arrive **pre-activated**?

So, after painstaking effort, you now have the ability to do exactly that...purchase Xumm (Tangem) cards with XRP ready to be added.&#x20;

This article talks about this idea and how to start your journey on the XRP Ledger with a new XRPL account and some XRP to get you going...ðŸ’ª

### Who is this for?

This is for the person who wants an easy way to get started on the XRP Ledger, for someone who might want to give a couple of Xumm (Tangem) cards as a gift, or just for someone just wants an XRP cold wallet without the hassle of having to deal with a third party to activate it.

### Is it safe?

The cards are shipped without an r-address.

We record the serial number of the card.

when you import the card into Xumm

See this article for details on how it works



### How much XRP comes with the card?

Up to **50** EUR/USD worth of XRP **plus** the base reserve.

(Since the price of XRP varies from day to day, the amount of XRP you will receive varies as well.)

For example, if XRP is worth 1 EURO each, you could purchase 50 EUR of XRP plus the base reserve. (The base reserve for an XRPL account is 10 XRP)&#x20;

So,  Base reserve = 10 XRP x 1 EUR each = 10 EUR\
&#x20;      Additional 50 EUR x 1 EUR per XRP - 50 XRP\
&#x20;      Total = 60 EUR





### Can i order a card with more than 10 XRP?
