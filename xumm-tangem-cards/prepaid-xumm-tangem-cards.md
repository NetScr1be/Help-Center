# Prepaid Xumm (Tangem) cards

\<This article is still under construction>

Let's face it, when it comes to getting started on the XRP Ledger, it can be a little bit complicated if you don't know what you're doing.  (First you have to create an XRPL account, then you have to figure out how to activate it.) We've create articles to try to make both steps as easy as possible...

* [How to create an XRPL account](../getting-started-with-xumm/your-first-xrp-ledger-account/how-to-create-an-xrpl-account.md)
* [Activating an XRPL account](../getting-started/how-to-activate-a-new-xrpl-account.md)

...but we thought to ourselves, what if we could make it even easier? What if we could make it so people would just have to purchase a Xumm (Tangem) card and it would arrive pre-activated?

This article talks about this idea and how to start your journey on the XRP Ledger with a new XRPL account and some XRP to get you going...ðŸ’ª
