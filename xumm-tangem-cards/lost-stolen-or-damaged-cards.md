# Lost, stolen or damaged cards

_**What happens if Card 2 is lost/stolen/damaged or destroyed?**_

* If Card 2 is **lost or stolen**, it will not be able to sign transactions without the passcode that you just set. It is useless without that passcode.
* If Card 2 is **damaged or destroyed**, you will go to your safe where Card 1 is and use it to sign transactions on your Card 1 account.

Regardless of what happens to Card 2, **Card 1** still has full signing access to your account.&#x20;
