# Lost, stolen or damaged cards

There are a **four** possible ways to configure the Xumm (Tangem) cards. Ideally Case 1 will apply to your situation but if not, one of the other cases will.&#x20;

### Case 1

You have followed our recommendations and have created a Primary account on one card and configured your second card as a Signing account as explained [**here**](how-to-configure-a-backup-signing-account.md).

If your _Signing account_ card is lost, stolen or damaged (LSD), you would simply "unlink" the card from your Primary account by removing the regular key. Here is how to this:

### Case 2

You have followed our recommendations and have created a Primary account on one card and configured your second card as a Signing account as explained [here](how-to-configure-a-backup-signing-account.md).

If your _Primary account_ card is LSD, you create a new XRPL account using Xumm, then move your funds over to the new account

### **Case 3**

You have not created a backup account.



### Case 4

You have configured a backup to another XRPL account.&#x20;
