# Lost, stolen or damaged cards

There are a **four** possible ways to configure the Xumm (Tangem) cards. Ideally Case 1 will apply to your situation but if not, one of the other cases will.&#x20;

### Case 1 - Signing account is LSD

You have followed our recommendations and have created a Primary account on one card and configured your second card as a Signing account as explained [**here**](how-to-configure-a-backup-signing-account.md).

If your _Signing account_ card is lost, stolen or damaged (LSD), you would simply "unlink" the card from your Primary account by removing the regular key. Here is how to this:

### Case 2 - Primary account is LSD

You have followed our recommendations and have created a Primary account on one card and configured your second card as a Signing account as explained [**here**](how-to-configure-a-backup-signing-account.md).

{% hint style="danger" %}
If your _Primary account_ card is been **lost or stolen**, time is of the essence since anyone who gets access to your Primary account card has direct access to your XRPL account and your funds.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

1\) Get your Signing account card.

2 In Xumm, [**create and activate a new XRPL account**](../getting-started-with-xumm/your-first-xrp-ledger-account/how-to-create-an-xrpl-account.md)&#x20;

3\) Move your funds from your Primary account over to the newly created account using the Signing account card to sign transactions on your Primary account.\
\
**Note**: Moving XRP to your new account will be easily accomplished but if your Primary account holds any tokens other than XRP, you will need to create a new Trust Line for each one in your new account.\
\
This article explains how to do this: [How to create a Trust Line](../getting-started-with-xumm/how-to-create-a-trust-line.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
If your _Primary account_ card is been **damaged or destroyed**, you have more time to decide how to proceed.
{% endhint %}

1\) If you carry your Signing card with you on a regular basis, you should stop doing this since the Signing card is the only way to access your Primary account now that the Primary account card is not longer functional.

2\) At this point, most people will decide to purchase another Xumm (Tangem) card to replace the damaged/destroyed one. Once the replacement card arrives, you can simply [add the card](../getting-started-with-xumm/importing-your-account/...a-xumm-tangem-card.md), [activate it](../getting-started/how-to-activate-a-new-xrpl-account.md), it then use the Signing card to move your funds from your Primary account over to the new card's account using the Signing account card to sign transactions on your Primary account.

3\) Once you have completed this process, you can configure the new card to be your new "Primary" account and link your existing Signing account card to your new card.  Here is how to do this: [How to configure backup signing account](how-to-configure-a-backup-signing-account.md) \


### **Case 3**

You have not created a backup account.



### Case 4

You have configured a backup to another XRPL account.&#x20;
