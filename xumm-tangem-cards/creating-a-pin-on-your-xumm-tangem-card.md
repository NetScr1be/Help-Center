# Creating a pin on your Xumm (Tangem) card

### **Is this really a good idea?**

One of the security features on a Xumm (Tangem) card is the ability to create a passcode or pin. Once enabled, the pin/passcode must be entered in order to sign with the card account.&#x20;

In certain situations, setting a pin can make a lot of sense.

For example, if you configure your cards as [recommended](getting-started....md), you will create a Primary account then set up a second card as a Signing account. This configuration allows you to store your Primary card in safe/secure location while using the Signing account to sign transactions on your Primary account.  In this case, assigning a pin to your Signing card adds an additional level of protection in case your card is ever stolen.

### **This sounds good, but what happens if I forget the pin?**

If you forget the pin on your Signing account, you will not be able to use the card to sign transactions on the Primary account. &#x20;

This is why we mentioned that setting the pin is useful only in certain situations. You could setup a pin on a single card, but there is no recovery feature or "back door" option to reset your pin.  If you forget the pin, your your funds will remain un-accessible until you remember it.

&#x20;

**I understand, if I forget the passcode, it's the same as losing the card. I won't be able to access my account. I am not going to forget my passcode and want to set one up. How do I proceed?**

1. Launch XUMM and press **Settings** -> **Accounts**&#x20;
2. Press the "**edit**" button side the account you would like to add a passcode on.
3. Select "**Card enforced security**"
4. Select "**Passcode**"
5. Press the "**Save**" button\
   \
   **Notice the warning!**\

   \

6. Press "**Yes, I'm Sure**"
7. Enter your new passcode.

Whenever you need to sign a transaction on Card 1's account with Card 2, you will now need to enter your Card 2 passcode.
