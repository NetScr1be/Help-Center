# Getting started...

If you just received your Xumm (Tangem) cards and you are not sure what to do with them or how to configure them, this is exactly where you want to be. Here we are going to go over the basics of the cards, how to use them and some general common questions related to the cards. By the end of this article you should feel pretty comformtable...?

### Taking a look at the cards

Most people will receive two cards:

and just to confirm, the cards are exactly the same, other than their appearance. We sent you two different cards so you can easily tell them apart. ðŸ˜‰

Each card comes with a built in NFC chip which you can clearly see in the transparent card in the image below. (We circled the location of the chip in the _<mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark>_ card so you know where it is.) When you are scanning the card with your phone, make sure you align the NFC chip with the NFC reader on your phone.&#x20;
