# Getting started...

If you just received your Xumm (Tangem) cards and you are not sure what to do with them or how to configure them, this is exactly where you want to be. We are going to go over the basics of the cards, how to use them and answer some common questions related to the cards.

### Taking a look at the cards

Most people will receive two cards:

and just to confirm, the cards are exactly the same, other than their appearance. We sent you two different cards so you can easily tell them apart! ðŸ˜‰

Each card comes with a built in NFC chip which you can clearly see in the transparent card in the image below. (We circled the location of the chip in the _<mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark>_ card so you know where it is as well.) When you are scanning the card with your phone, make sure you align the NFC chip with the NFC reader on your phone.&#x20;

### What are the cards for...

The main functions of a Xumm (Tangem) card are:

* to securely create an account secret for an XRP Ledger account
* store that account secret securely on the card
* sign transactions on the card with the account secret

There are multiple use case and ways to configure the cards, but the core feature of the card is that it allows you to sign transactions on your XRPL account.

Keep in mind, since the account secret is stored on the card, this means that the only way you can sign transactions on your XRPL account, is if you **physically have** the card. While this feature certainly proves security, for some people it might be considered less convenient than a regular XRPL account.&#x20;

We make a couple of recommendations below which you should review to better understand this.

### What the cards are not for...

The cards can not connect to your bank account. You can not use them at an ATM.&#x20;

They are not debit cards or a credit cards.&#x20;

They do not store XRP on them and they do not come with XRP.

### Our recommendations...

We know that the Xumm (Tangem) card is basically an "account on a card", and that the only way to access the account is if you physically possess the card, so consider this possibility...

What happens if your card is lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed?

If any of these situations happened, you would lose access to your account and your **funds would be lost**.  The only way to access your card account is if you have the card, unless...

#### Recommendation 1 - Make a backup card

This is the main reason we send you two cards. We want you to create a "backup" card so in the event that your primary card is lost, stolen or damaged, you can still access your funds. Check out this article on how to do this:

### What are the differences between the cards and regular Xumm account

| Feature | Xumm (Tangem) card account | Regular Xumm account |
| ------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
|         |                            |                      |
|         |                            |                      |
|         |                            |                      |
|         |                            |                      |



Just like Xumm, the chances of guessing the account secret is 1 out of 340 undecillion.

Here are some more facts about the cards.

* Contains $0 & 0 XRP in value upon delivery: the card will generate a keypair when first used with Xumm, and the newly generated keypair (and r-address on the XRPL) will have to be [activated with 10 XRP as per XRP Ledger requirement](https://support.xumm.app/hc/en-us/articles/360018166079) first.
* Card dimensions: 85.60 mm x 54.00 mm x 0.80 mm
* Weight: about 4 grams
* **S3D350A microchip from Samsung**
* **Common Criteria EAL6+ Assurance Level**
* Uses 3DES, AES, RSA, & ECC cryptography
* **Arm SecurCore SC000 Core**
* Compatible with Android 5.1+ or iPhone with NFC (select models, iOS 13+)
* **Firmware** [**audited**](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2018/08/06/audit-of-tangems-smartcard-wallet-code/) **by Kudelski Security**
* wallet can withstand temperatures ranging from -35 to 50 degrees Celsius for up to 50 years.
* In fact, the card is so durable that it is one of the few hardware wallets to have received an IP68 certification
* The cards are dust,water, heat and cold resistant. They can withstand environmental extremes from **-25â„ƒ up to 85â„ƒ**, occasional mechanical deformation, electromagnetic pulse (EMP), electrostatic discharge (ESD) and X-rays within limits defined in [ISO7810](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC\_7810) standard.
