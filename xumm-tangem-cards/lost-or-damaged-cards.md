# Lost or damaged cards

### Introduction

One of the great features of a Xumm (Tangem) card is that they generate a new XRP Ledger account secret directly on each card. Since this is done "off line", there is no way for anyone to know the account secret which means that the only way to access the card account is if you have the physical card. You must have the card otherwise there is no way to access the account.

So what happens if you lose the card, or if the card is damaged, destroyed or stolen?

If any of these options happened, you would lose access to your account. The only way to access a card account is with the card. There is no recovery option.

This is why we always ship two cards with every Xumm Pro order and don't offer the option to purchase single cards. We want people to configure a second card as a backup to the first card so it something happens to one of the cards, you still have a way to access the funds in your account.
