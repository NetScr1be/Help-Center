# How to link a Xumm card to an existing XRPL account

### Introduction

In an ideal situation, the cards will be configured in the following way:

1\) Import two Xumm cards into Xumm.

2\) Activate one of the cards (the Primary card) and leave the other one un-activated. (The Backup card)

3\) Run the Tangem Backup xApp and link the two cards together.

See this article for complete instructions:

{% endcontent-ref %}

By configuring the cards this way, you ensure that any funds stored on the Primary card account will not be lost in case the one of the cards is damaged or destroyed.

### Linking the cards to an existing account

#### Step 1: Make sure you have a Primary account <a href="#h_46e6d7f417" id="h_46e6d7f417"></a>

The Primary account must be imported into Xumm with **Full access**. (You must be able to sign transactions on this account.)

This is your existing account that will have your XRP, your Trust Lines, Escrows, DEX transactions, etc.

#### Step 2: Import your new Xumm card into Xumm <a href="#h_daeec8d8c2" id="h_daeec8d8c2"></a>

The Signing account must be imported into Xumm with **Full access**. (You must be able to sign transactions on this account.)

This account does not need to contain XRP and does not even need to be activated. As long as you have full access to the account, it can be used to sign transactions on the Primary account.

1\) Import you card into Xumm by following the these instructions:

{% content-ref url="../getting-started-with-xumm/importing-your-account/...a-xumm-tangem-card.md" %}
[...a-xumm-tangem-card.md](../getting-started-with-xumm/importing-your-account/...a-xumm-tangem-card.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
