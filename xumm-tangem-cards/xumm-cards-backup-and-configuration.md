# Xumm Cards - Backup & Configuration

**Start by configuring a backup card**

Configuring a back-up card for you existing Tangem card provides another layer of safety for your assets.

Consider the possibilities..

* Your card is lost
* Your card is stolen
* Your card is damaged&#x20;
* Your card is destroyed
* Your pet alligator finds your card and chews on it

We have an xApp called, "**Tangem Backup**" which will walk you through the process.

You can find it in XUMM by pressing the "xâˆš" button at the button of the screen.

_**OK, that was SUPER easy, now what?**_

So you have two cards, Card 1 and Card 2.

Card 1 is the card that you used to create your XRPL account.&#x20;

Card 2 is the backup card for Card 1.

&#x20;

**Create a passcode on Card 2**

The XUMM Tangem card has the option to add a "Passcode" to a card. This feature provides another level of security to your account and can be easily configured.

1. Launch XUMM and press **Settings** -> **Accounts**&#x20;
2. Press the "**Edit**" button beside Card 2.
3. Select "**Card enforced security**"
4. Select "**Passcode**"
5. Press the "**Save**" button\
   \
   **Notice the warning!**\

   \

6. Press "**Yes, I'm Sure**"
7. Enter your new passcode.
8. Sign with Card 2.

Whenever you need to sign a transaction on Card 1's account with Card 2, you will now need to enter your Card 2 passcode.

At this point, you should put **Card 1** into a safe and secure location. It has effectively become your "backup" card now since you should now be **using Card 2 to sign** daily transactions on Card 1's account.

&#x20;

_**What happens if Card 2 is lost/stolen/damaged or destroyed?**_

* If Card 2 is **lost or stolen**, it will not be able to sign transactions without the passcode that you just set. It is useless without that passcode.
* If Card 2 is **damaged or destroyed**, you will go to your safe where Card 1 is and use it to sign transactions on your Card 1 account.

Regardless of what happens to Card 2, **Card 1** still has full signing access to your account.&#x20;
