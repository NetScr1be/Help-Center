# How to configure biometrics

Biometric authentication is a security process that involves using some part of your physical body to authenticate you. In the case of Xumm, a fingerprint or face scan.&#x20;

## Setting up biometrics

There are couple of things that you should be aware of before you configure Xumm to use biometrics:

* Xumm does not create or store your biometric information. It relies on your phone to manage this data.
* Configuring Xumm to use biometrics does not replace your 6 digit passcode. You can still use your passcode to access Xumm.
* You must configure **both** your fingerprint **and** your face scan on your phone before Xumm will enable biometrics. Configuring one or the other **will not work**.

As long as you have successfully setup your fingerprint and face scan on your phone, enabling biometrics can be easily done by:

1\) Launch Xumm and press the **Settings** button.

2\) Tab the **Security** option.

2\) Tap the **Biometric authentication** button.

## Additional things to consider

* Once biometrics has been enabled in Xumm, it will continually check the biometric configuration on your phone to see there have been any changes. Any updates/additions/modifications to the biometric config files on your device and Xumm automatically disable biometric authentication and revert exclusively to the six digit passcode configured during the initial Xumm setup.\
  \
  We did this because an attacker with access to your phone could add their own fingerprint, thus granting themselves access not only to your phone but also to your Xumm wallet.\
  \
  If this happens, just disabled Biometric authentication in Xumm, reboot your phone, then launch Xumm and re-enable Biometric authentication.
*

On most phones, you can re-enable the biometric authentication feature via the _**Security**_ section in _Xumm._ To get there, press _**Settings**_ -> _**Security**_ -> **Biometric authentication**   ![mceclip1.png](https://drtc9zr.dlvr.cloud/hc/article\_attachments/5891226989970/mceclip1.png)&#x20;

**Samsung phones**

On some phones, you may encounter the follow message,

In order to fix this, you need to have BOTH a Fingerprint and a Face ID configured in order for it to work.

Go into _**Settings**_ on your phone and select _**Biometrics and security**_.

Make sure you have both face **and** fingerprints setup.
