# How to configure biometrics

## **Background**

Biometric authentication is a security process that involves using some part of your physical body to authenticate you. In the case of Xumm, a fingerprint or face scan.&#x20;

Biometric authentication is one of the cool features of Xumm but since it involves allowing access to the app or signing transactions, it is highly managed.

**New Security Features in Xumm v2.3**

We upgraded the security of the biometric feature in Xumm v2.3.

If you use your finger print or face scan to open Xumm and/or sign transactions, Xumm will now check if the authorized fingerprint(s) / face(s) have been updated on your phone. If they have been updated, (in the iOS/Android security settings), Xumm will disable biometric authentication and revert exclusively to the six digit passcode configured during the initial Xumm setup.

We did this because an attacker with access to your phone could add their own fingerprint, thus granting themselves access not only to your phone but also to your Xumm wallet.

On most phones, you can re-enable the biometric authentication feature via the _**Security**_ section in _Xumm._ To get there, press _**Settings**_ -> _**Security**_ -> **Biometric authentication**   ![mceclip1.png](https://drtc9zr.dlvr.cloud/hc/article\_attachments/5891226989970/mceclip1.png)&#x20;

**Samsung phones**

On some phones, you may encounter the follow message,

![mceclip0.png](https://drtc9zr.dlvr.cloud/hc/article\_attachments/5968027431570/mceclip0.png)

In order to fix this, you need to have BOTH a Fingerprint and a Face ID configured in order for it to work.

Go into _**Settings**_ on your phone and select _**Biometrics and security**_.

Make sure you have both face **and** fingerprints setup.
