# Sending tokens from Xumm

Sending tokens from Xumm is a very easy process. In fact, sending tokens is one if its primary functions! Here is how it's done...

### **Step 1**

From the main screen in Xumm, press the **Send** button.

On the following screen, you will see the option to enter the **amount** you would like to send.

(You can also change the account you would like to send the tokens **from** and you can change the **type** of token you would like to send.)

In our case, we are going to send 1 XRP from our account.

Press the **Next** button to continue.

### **Step 2**

In this screen you can enter the **recipient's** account that you are sending your tokens to.

Keep in mind, there are two types of accounts on the XRPL.

* **Self custodial** accounts - You are solely responsible for managing your private keys.
* **Custodial** accounts - A company is responsible for managing the private keys to their account. (Usually a crypto exchange.) You are assigned an account number with the exchange called a destination tag.

Both types of accounts will have an r-address but a custodial account will also require a destination tag. (More about destination tags later.)

Press **Next** after you have entered/selected the correct destination r-address.
