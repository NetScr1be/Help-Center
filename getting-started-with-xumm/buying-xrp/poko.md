# Poko

Poko is a service aggregator. They do not offer on/off-ramp services directly, instead, they have partnered with several on-ramp providers and provide you with the option to choose which one you would like to purchase XRP from.

Some of their partners include:

* Transak
* Chainverse
* Fiahub
* LocalRamp
* Loopipay
* Moonpay
* Onmeta
* Onramp Money
* Payfura
* Sardine

## Customer Service

Since Poko simply facilitates transactions between you and their partners, they do not offer customer support or answer questions related to their service. If you have _**any questions**_ about a particular transaction, you will need to contact the appropriate partner for assistance.

To find a list of Poko's partner contacts, launch the Poko xApp then tap the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)
