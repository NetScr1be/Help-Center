# How to create a Trust Line

There are two easy ways to create Trust Line using Xumm:

1\) Selecting one of the pre-vetted tokens from our short list

2\) Visiting XRPL.Services and sign using Xumm

### **What is the Xumm short list?**

The "short list" is the list of tokens that is presented when you press the _**+Add**_ button on the main screen of Xumm.

Xumm will display a screen that looks like this:

&#x20;  there some tokens which have been vetted by our internal compliance department which have been included on our 'short list'. Creating a Trust Line from the short list is the easiest way to create a Trust Line.

If the token you are looking for is not on the short list, you can manually add one by visiting XRPL.Services and following the instructions below.
