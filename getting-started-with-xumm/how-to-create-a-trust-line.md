# How to create a Trust Line

There are two easy ways to create Trust Line using Xumm:

1\) Selecting one of the pre-vetted tokens from our short list

2\) Visiting XRPL.Services and sign using Xumm

### **What is the Xumm short list?**

The "short list" is the list of tokens that is presented when you press the _**+Add**_ button on the main screen of Xumm.

Xumm will display a screen that looks like this:

From here you can simply select an issuer, for example, **Gatehub**, then choose which Token you would like to create a Trust Line for, in this case, we'll choose **British Pound**, then **press Sign to add Token.**

Xumm will craft a transaction with the details of the Trust Line and after you have reviewed them, you can **Slide to accept**. &#x20;

You should see a warning message cautioning you about the potential dangers, then press **Continue**.&#x20;

Finally, either enter your **passcode/signing password/biometrics** to sign the transaction and the Trust Line will be created.



there some tokens which have been vetted by our internal compliance department which have been included on our 'short list'. Creating a Trust Line from the short list is the easiest way to create a Trust Line.

If the token you are looking for is not on the short list, you can manually add one by visiting XRPL.Services and following the instructions below.
