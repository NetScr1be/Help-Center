### A hot wallet vs. a cold wallet

When choosing between and hot or cold wallet, there are three primary things you need to consider:

* Your security habits and preferences
* How easy you would like to access your funds
* How much crypto you intend to hold in you XRPL account

#### Security

A hot wallet such as Xumm stores your account secret on your mobile device. The assumption is that at some point, you will connect to the internet and that your account secret will be more vulnerable to potential attack vectors while online.

A cold wallet stores your account secret on separate device. Since the device is not directly connected to the internet and exposed to the internet less frequently, it is less vulnerable to potential attack vectors and therefore somehow "safer".

The truth is, determining how "safe" a particular wallet is does not come down to being online or offline. Every wallet type has its own potential attack vectors and your security habits, preferences  and preparations play a huge part in how safe your funds are. The most secure wallet in the world is useless if you voluntarily give your account secret away. The best cold wallet on the planet is not going to help keep your funds safe if the computer that you put in into is compromised. Simply saying a cold wallet is more secure or safer than a hot wallet is not an accurate way of describing security features.





The main sales pitch for cold wallets is that your private keys are "safer" if they are stored off line so they can not be easily attacked, however, there are several use cases for hardware wallets including portability and convenience.

Bringing an account that was created on a hardware wallet on line does not necessarily defeat its purpose, depending on why the hardware device was purchased in the first place, A quick search on the internet will reveal that several different cold wallets have been successfully "hacked" while several different hot wallets have not.
