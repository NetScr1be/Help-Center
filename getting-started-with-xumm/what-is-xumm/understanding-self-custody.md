# Understanding Self custody

If you are just getting started with crypto and blockchain, one of the biggest challenges can be trying to figure out what all of the different terms and fancy words mean. If you are thinking about installing Xumm and are wondering what exactly words like "custodial", "non-custodial", "un-hosted" "self-custody" and "hosted" refer to, this article is going to help get you up to speed.

Most people are familiar with the general idea of what a bank is and how they work. In simple terms, a bank is a business that deals with money. As a customer, you can open an account with a bank and deposit money into that account. The bank holds that money for you until you decide how you would like to use your funds.  This is an example of a "custodial" or "hosted" account. The bank created an account on their "hosted" system (on their computers which they own and operate) and agree to take "custody" of your funds. While your funds are in their custody, they have certain obligations and responsibilities which are, in theory, over seen by local/federal governments who are supposed to ensure that the banks act in a responsible and transparent way.

Most of the time accessing your funds is a fairly easy and straight forward process but their are several situations where a bank can decide to restrict access to your money.

* They suspect you laundering money, financing terrorism, writing bad checks on your account.
* If a creditor has a claim against your funds
* If the government determines you owe them money (taxes, fines, penalties, etc.)

Banks can also decide who and where you can send your money to if they don't think you are making good financial decisions.

For example, a large, multinational bank in the UK informed their customers...

"It’s our responsibility to help protect your money. With this in mind we’ve taken the decision to stop payments made by credit/debit card to Binance until further notice, to help keep your money safe."

Fortunately, many people want their banks and governments to make these types of financial decisions for them so custodial accounts make a lot of sense for those who prefer to leave their funds in control of someone else.&#x20;

### A second choice...

When it comes to the XRP Ledger, there are several **crypto exchanges** which offer **custodial accounts**. Similar to bank account, you can open an account with a crypto exchange and deposit money into that account. The crypto exchange holds that money for you until you decide how you would like to use it.  This is another example of a "custodial" or "hosted" account. The exchange created an account on their "hosted" system (on their computers which they own and operate) and agree to take "custody" of your funds. Most people will use their funds to purchase various crypto currencies, which the exchange "holds" for them in their exchange accounts.
