# ðŸ¥³ Updating to Xumm v2.4 !

### Welcome to the latest version!

If you are interested in learning about some of the main changes and features of Xumm v2.4, you're at the right place! This version includes many different upgrades, new features, tweaks and improvements and while many of them are "behind the scene" improvements, there are some things you will notice and appreciate right away, so let's get started...&#x20;

### Get the value of your XRP on the main screen

When our customers speak, we listen, so when you asked for Xumm to display the fiat value of your XRP on the main page, we added it. Just touch the balance of your XRP and voila, the cash equivalent.&#x20;
