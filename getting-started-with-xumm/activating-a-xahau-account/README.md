# Activating a Xahau account

An account on the Xahau network will hold all your balances, allow you to send and receive payments,  let you place buy and sell offers on the Xahau DEX and allow you to use Hooks.

Since everything on Xahau involves an account, you are going to need to activate yours in order to start using it. A Xahau account is activated when a minimum of 1 XAH is sent to it.  An account can be activated several ways but regardless of how it is activated, the first 1 XAH deposited into an Xahau account is used to meet the reserve requirements and is not spendable.

There are three main ways to activate an account on the Xahau network:\
\
1\) Via an exchange.\
\
Crypto exchanges like Bitrue support the Xahau network. You can purchase XAH on their platform, then send the XAH to your Xahau account managed by Xaman. You will find instructions on how to do this here:

[bitrue.md](bitrue.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2\) Via another Xahau account.

If you already have XAH in a Xahau account, you can send XAH coins between your accounts to activate them. This applies to your friends, family, co-workers, etc. If they have a Xahau account, they can send XAH to your account to activate it. In fact, any Xahau account can be activated from any other Xahau account. They just need to send 1 XAH to it.
