# Activating a Xahau account

An account on the Xahau network will hold all your balances, allow you to send and receive payments,  let you place buy and sell offers on the Xahau DEX and allow you to use Hooks.

Since everything on Xahau involves an account, you are going to need to activate yours in order to start using it. A Xahau account is activated when a minimum of 1 XAH is sent to it.  An account can be activated several ways but regardless of how it is activated, the first 1 XAH deposited into an Xahau account is used to meet the reserve requirements and is not spendable.

The articles in this section explain various ways you can activate your account.

#### Activate by obtaining XAH from an exchange:

{% content-ref url="bitrue.md" %}
[bitrue.md](bitrue.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Or by Burn To Mint some XRP from the XRP Ledger to Xahau:**

{% content-ref url="../importing-your-account-xahau/" %}
[importing-your-account-xahau](../importing-your-account-xahau/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
