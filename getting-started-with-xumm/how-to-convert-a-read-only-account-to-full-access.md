# How to convert a Read only account to Full Access

In Xumm it is possible to import an account as Full access mode or Read only mode.

In **Full access** mode, you can interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

In **Read only** mode you can follow the activity of an XRPL account but not sign transactions on the account.&#x20;

Most people choose to import their accounts with Full access but if you are interested in just monitoring an account's activity, you can import in **Read only** mode.



1\) Launch Xumm then press the **Settings** button, choose **Accounts** then press the **+ Add account** button.
