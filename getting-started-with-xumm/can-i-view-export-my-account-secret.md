# Can I view/export my account secret?

On the XRP Ledger, a private key is called an **account secret**.

An account secret can come in various forms:

* _Secret Numbers_: If your XRP Ledger account was created using Xumm, you would have received a set of secret numbers. (8 rows, A-H, each with 6 digits)
* _Family Seed_: A 29 character string of numbers and letters starting with the letter "s".
* _Mnemonic_: A set of 12, 16 or 24 words chosen from the [BIP 39 list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).

Each account on the XRPL will have its own account secret and in order to access that account, you need to know the correct account secret.

### **Can I see my account secret in Xumm?**

Xumm does **not** display account secrets.

If your XRP Ledger account was created using Xumm, you had only had one opportunity to see the secret numbers, (when the account is created), after that, there is no way to access, view or export them.

## Frequently asked Questions

#### **I created my XRPL account outside of Xumm...**

Depending on how you created your XRPL account, it is possible that the website or application that you used might have kept a copy of your account secret or has the ability to recover it. You can try to contact them and see if they might be able to recover them for you.\

**I created my XRPL account during the CasinoCoin swap...**

Accounts that were created during the CasinoCoin swap used a slightly different method of generating an account secret.

For information on how to access an account created during the CSC swap, check out this article:

**What are some good practices for storing my account secret(s)?**

Storing your account secret(s) is VERY important and it is vital that you keep them in a safe place and **never** reveal them to anyone. If in doubt, here are some good guidelines:

* **Clearly** write your account secret down on a piece of paper and store them in a safe place. (Some people write and store them in multiple locations.)
* **Never** store your account secret online.&#x20;
* **Never** enter your account secret into a website
* **Never** enter your account secret into an online support form
* **Never** enter your account secret into a random wallet (even if it is from an app store) unless you trust it 100%
* **Never** trust anyone asking you to "authenticate your wallet"

You might also consider a product such as an [Arkplate](https://www.arkplate.com/product/xumm/5?cs=true\&cst=custom). A device like this allows you store your account secret on a metal plate which is fire proof and very durable.

Finally, it is **not** a good idea to have a digit copy of your account secret stored on your phone or computer. Should your device ever get compromised, your account secret could fall into the wrong hands...

**What about a Xumm card?**

Xumm cards are a great way to safely store an account secret for an XRP Ledger account. When you first activate a Xumm card an account secret is generated **on the card** and is not displayed. This means that you don't need to write down and store your account secret, it is safely stored on the card for you!
