# Can I view/export my account secret?

On the XRP Ledger, a private key is called an **account secret**.

An account secret can come in various forms:

* _Secret Numbers_: If your XRP Ledger account was created using Xumm, you would have received a set of secret numbers. (8 rows, A-H, each with 6 digits)
* _Family Seed_: A 29 character string of numbers and letters starting with the letter "s".
* _Mnemonic_: A set of 12, 16 or 24 words chosen from the [BIP 39 list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).

Each account on the XRPL will have its own account secret and in order to access that account, you need to know the correct account secret.

### **Can I see my account secret in Xumm?**

Xumm does **not** display account secrets.

If your XRP Ledger account was created using Xumm, you had only had one opportunity to see the secret numbers, (when the account is created), after that, there is no way to access, view or export them.
