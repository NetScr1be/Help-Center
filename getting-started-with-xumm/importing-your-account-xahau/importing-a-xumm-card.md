# Duplicating a Xumm card account on Xahau

### Background

If you already have a Xumm card and have configured it on according to these instructions:

{% content-ref url="../../xumm-tangem-cards/getting-started.md" %}
[getting-started.md](../../xumm-tangem-cards/getting-started.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

this article will walk you through duplicating your account (and your Backup account) on the Xahau network.

### How it works

In order to access an account on the XRP Ledger, you must know the account secret (private keys) for that account. Xaman (formerly Xumm) is an application that helps manage your account secret(s) and allows you to access your XRPL account. This processes authorizes Xumm to use the account secret for your XRPL account for a duplicate account on Xahau.

### Getting started...&#x20;

The following process has two requirements:

* Your account must be [**activated**](../../getting-started/how-to-activate-a-new-xrpl-account.md) on the XRPL.
* Your account must be imported into Xumm with full access.

As long as both of these requirements are met, here are the instructions.
