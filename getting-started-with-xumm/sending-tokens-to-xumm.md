# Sending tokens to Xumm

**Introduction**

If you are new to Xumm, it can be a little bit confusing to understand what all the buttons and features do. Trust us when we say, it does get easier after a little bit of practice! ðŸ˜‰

This article talks about how to send funds using Xumm.

### **Background**

The first thing to know is that all tokens issued on the XRP Ledger use the same r-address to send and receive as XRP does.

For example, if you want send XRP to your account, you would send it to your r-address. In Xumm you can find your r-address here:

Now, letâ€™s say you want to send another token to your account, for example, CasinoCoin (CSC), you would send it to the same r-address as you would if you were sending XRP. (In this case, **rAtLaNtiSod5cBiw4vjqtoPBLEbXNg**.)

â€¦and if you wanted to send a different token to your account, maybe, Sologenic (SOLO) or Coreum (CORE) or Elysium (ELS), they would all use the same r-address. (Again, in this case, **rAtLaNtiSod5cBiw4vjqtoPBLEbXNg**.)

In all of the above cases, the relevant Trust Line needs to be set before the token will show as an asset in the destination account.
