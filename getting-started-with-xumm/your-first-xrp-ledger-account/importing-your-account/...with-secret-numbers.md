You can import an XRP Ledger in either of these two modes:

**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

Most people choose to import their accounts with **Full access** so they can interact with the XRP Ledger.

Once you have decided, you will be able to choose which secret type that you have:\

Xumm is compatible with all industry standard account secrets. In this case we will choose the Secret Numbers.

When you created your XRP Ledger account using Xumm, you would have received a set of secret numbers consisting of 8 rows, (A-H), each with 6 digits.  You will need to have those numbers in order to proceed.

We are going to choose the **Secret numbers** option and press **Next**.

Please ensure that r-address that is displayed is the one that you intend to import. If it is **not correct**, please press the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line">button, then double check and re-enter your secret numbers. When the correct r-address is displayed, press the **Confirm** button.
