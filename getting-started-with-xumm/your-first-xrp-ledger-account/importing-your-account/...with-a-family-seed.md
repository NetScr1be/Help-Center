# ...with a Family Seed

From the main screen of Xumm, press **Settings** -> **Accounts** -> **+ Add account** -> **Import an existing account**. You should see this screen:

You can import an XRP Ledger in either of these two modes:

**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

Most people choose to import their accounts with **Full access** so they can interact with the XRPL community.

Once you have decided, you will be able to choose which secret type that you have:

Xumm is compatible with all industry standard account secrets but in this we will choose **Family Seed** and press **Next**.
