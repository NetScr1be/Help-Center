### Introduction

Xumm is an excellent application for making payments on the XRP Ledger, interacting with the XRPL ecosystem and for safely storing your private keys. As a hot wallet, it is convenient,easy to use, and very secure and although it is compatible with all account secret types, there may be a couple of reasons you might not want to import your mnemonic into Xumm...

### A hot wallet vs. a cold wallet

When choosing between and hot or cold wallet, there are three primary things you need to consider:

* Your security habits and preferences
* How easy you would like to access your funds
* How much crypto you intend to hold in you XRPL account

Security

A hot wallet such as Xumm stores your account secret on your mobile device. The assumption is that at some point, you will connect to the internet and that your account secret will be more vulnerable to potential attack vectors while online.

A cold wallet such as a Xumm (Tangem) card stores your account secret on the card. Since the card is not directly connected to the internet, the card is less vulnerable potential attack vectors and therefore somehow "safer".





When it comes to the safety of your assets, it is our primary focusthere are&#x20;

in that your private keys are encrypted on your phone. which is presumably connected to the internet at various times. The assumption is that if you phone is connected to the internet your private keys are more vulnerable.

A cold wallet will store your private keys "off line" on a separate device where your private keys will be exposed to the internet less frequently, therefore, making them less vulnerable.

The main sales pitch for cold wallets is that your private keys are "safer" if they are stored off line so they can not be easily attacked, however, there are several use cases for hardware wallets including portability and convenience.

Bringing an account that was created on a hardware wallet on line does not necessarily defeat its purpose, depending on why the hardware device was purchased in the first place, A quick search on the internet will reveal that several different cold wallets have been successfully "hacked" while several different hot wallets have not.
