### Introduction

Xumm is an excellent application for making payments on the XRP Ledger, interacting with the XRPL ecosystem and for safely storing your private keys. As a hot wallet, it is convenient,easy to use, and very secure and although it is compatible with all account secret types, there may be a couple of reasons you might not want to import your mnemonic into Xumm...

### How was the mnemonic generated?

There are a number of wallets which generate a mnemonic as their account secret. If your mnemonic was generated by a [cold wallet](../../what-is-xumm/hot-wallets-vs.-cold-wallets.md), you should consider the following before you import your mnemonic into Xumm:

* Your security habits, preferences and practices
* How easy you would like to access your funds
* How much crypto you intend to hold in you XRPL account

#### Security

Xumm stores your account secret on your mobile device. The assumption is that at some point, you will connect to the internet and that your account secret will be more vulnerable to potential attack vectors while online.

A cold wallet such as a Ledger Nano stores your account secret on a USB device. Since the device is not directly connected to the internet, it less vulnerable to potential attack vectors and therefore somehow "safer".

The truth is, determining how "safe" a particular wallet is does not come down to being online or offline. Every wallet type has its own potential attack vectors and your security habits, preferences  and preparations play a huge part in how safe your funds are. The most secure wallet in the world is useless if you voluntarily give your account secret away. The best cold wallet on the planet is not going to help keep your funds safe if the computer that you put in into is compromised. Simply saying a cold wallet is more secure or safer than a hot wallet is not an accurate way of describing security features.
