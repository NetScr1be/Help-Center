You will need to **carefully** write all of the numbers down in the correct order. These numbers are used to generate your private keys. It is vital that you record these numbers correctly and store them in a safe place. After writing down the first row of numbers, press **Next** to see the following row. Repeat this process until you have recorded all of the secret numbers.

The next part of the process is to manually enter all of the secret numbers back into Xumm. You can use the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt="" data-size="line">buttons and the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">buttons to do this.
