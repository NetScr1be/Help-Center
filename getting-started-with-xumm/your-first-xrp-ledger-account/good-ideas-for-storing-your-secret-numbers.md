If the answer is **No**, keep reading...



Storing your account secret(s) is VERY important and it is vital that you keep them in a safe place and **never** reveal them to anyone. If in doubt, here are some good guidelines:

* **Clearly** write your account secret down on a piece of paper and store them in a safe place. (Some people write and store them in multiple locations.)
* **Never** store your account secret online.
* **Never** create a digit copy of your account secret on your phone or your computer.&#x20;
* **Never** enter your account secret into a website
* **Never** enter your account secret into an online support form
* **Never** enter your account secret into a random wallet (even if it is from an app store) unless you trust it 100%
* **Never** trust anyone asking you to "authenticate your wallet"

You might also consider a product such as an [Arkplate](https://www.arkplate.com/product/xumm/5?cs=true\&cst=custom). A device like this allows you store your account secret on a metal plate which is fire proof and very durable.

Never keep private keys online, in the mail, or the cloud because they are most susceptible to getting hacked there. Many users take screenshots of their private keys, and their photo album is usually synced online. This creates a security risk and is something you should never do. Instead, store them in various other cold storage as discussed in this article: [_What Is Cold Storage In Cryptocurrency?_](https://coinsutra.com/cold-storage-cryptocurrency/)

You should instead write down your private key.

You can use a combination of Stonebook and Ghost pen to store your private keys on a piece of paper.
