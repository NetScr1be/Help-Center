# Good ideas for storing your secret numbers

Storing your account secret(s) is VERY important and it is vital that you keep them in a safe place and **never** reveal them to anyone. If in doubt, here are some good guidelines:

* **Clearly** write your account secret down on a piece of paper and store them in a safe place. (Some people write and store them in multiple locations.)
* **Never** store your account secret online.
* **Never** create a digit copy of your account secret on your phone or your computer.&#x20;
* **Never** enter your account secret into a website
* **Never** enter your account secret into an online support form
* **Never** enter your account secret into a random wallet (even if it is from an app store) unless you trust it 100%
* **Never** trust anyone asking you to "authenticate your wallet"

You might also consider a product such as an [Arkplate](https://www.arkplate.com/product/xumm/5?cs=true\&cst=custom). A device like this allows you store your account secret on a metal plate which is fire proof and very durable.
