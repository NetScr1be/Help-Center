# ...with a Mnemonic

XRPL accounts that are created using Xumm provide a set of Secret Numbers which allow you to access them.

Since your XRPL account was created using another wallet / platform, you might want to consider creating a new account using Xumm and leave your mnemonic account off-line.  If you are interested in learning why, check out this article:

You can import an XRP Ledger account in either of these two modes:

**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

Most people choose to import their accounts with **Full access** so they can interact with the XRPL community.

Once you have decided, you will be able to choose which secret type that you have:
