# Should I import my XRP Ledger account into Xumm?

Xumm is an excellent application for making payments on the XRP Ledger, interacting with the XRPL ecosystem and for safely storing your private keys. For many people, moving their existing XRPL accounts over to Xumm makes a lot of sense. Xumm is convenient, easy to use, and very secure, so why not import your account into Xumm to take advantage of all these features...?

### Hardware wallets vs Xumm

Hardware wallets are largely about **long term storage** of your assets. A hardware wallet stores the  private keys for your XRP Ledger account on a device that is not connected to the internet. You can only sign transactions on your XRPL account if you are in possession of the hardware device. By storing your private keys off line, it limits some potential attack vectors on your account.

Xumm is largely about enabling you to interact with the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Xumm stores your private keys for your XRP Ledger account on your mobile device. (Which is connected to the internet.) It allows you to sign transactions on your XRPL account on your phone. By storing your private keys on a device that is "on line", it exposes your account to other types of potential attack vectors.&#x20;

### Potential risks...

Any time you enter your private keys into any software there are potential risks. Spyware, malware, key-loggers, screen capture software, viruses, and many more attack vectors can come into play when entering your private keys. If you are planning on importing your existing XRPL account, please take the time to consider some of the risks associated with doing this.

#### How were your private keys generated?&#x20;

* Do you trust the company/service that generated your keys?
* What was the source of entropy that was used to generate your keys?
* Has that source been audited?&#x20;

#### How are your private keys stored?

* Can your keys be viewed using your current wallet?&#x20;
* Does your previous wallet have a way of displaying your private keys?&#x20;
* Are your private keys stored online? (ie. in a "cloud backup"?) Which encryption method was used to store your keys?

#### Why are you importing your account?

* Are you planning to participate in the XRP Ledger community?
* Do you want to be able to access your hardware wallet account using Xumm?

While importing private keys into Xumm is certainly easy to do, you should consider why you are taking the risk of importing them into Xumm when there is a much safer option...ðŸ¤”

### Our Recommendation

The safest way to protect your funds is to [**create a** **new XRPL account**](../your-first-xrp-ledger-account/how-to-create-an-xrpl-account.md) using Xumm, then move your assets to your new account. There are a number of benefits to doing this:

* Accounts generated by Xumm use a world-class algorithm to generate a set of eight, six-digit Secret Numbers used to recover the account. Our algorithm has been audited and tested hundreds of thousands of times. You can trust that your Secret Numbers will not be duplicated by any other software or service.&#x20;
* Xumm only displays the account secret once, when an account is generated. There is no way to access or view it after it is initially displayed. No one, other than you will ever see the account secret after the account is created.
* After a new account is generated, the [**account secret is encrypted**](../../security-and-xumm/all-about-security/upgrading-your-encryption.md) and immediately stored in Xumm. The algorithm we use to encrypt it is exceptionally secure.  &#x20;
* If something were to ever go wrong, it is much easier to narrow down the source of the issue if the account was generated in Xumm. \


### Frequently Asked Questions

#### I want to import my hardware wallet account into Xumm.

Consider the reason why you want to do this. For most hardware wallets, the main selling feature is that they generate and store the private keys for an account "off line". Doing this limits some potential attack vectors on your account.

By importing your hardware wallet account into Xumm, you are bringing your private keys into a software wallet (Xumm) which is "on line".  (ie. Xumm is installed on a mobile device which is most likely connected to the internet at various times throughout the day.)  Doing this will negate the main selling feature of your hardware wallet.  Are you sure this is what you want to do?

#### Instead of importing my hardware wallet, can I just configure a regular key to it?

Rather than importing your private key for your hardware wallet account into Xumm, it is possible to configure a regular key to your hardware wallet account and import it into Xumm instead.

As long as you understand that doing this will allow you to **access your hardware wallet account directly using Xumm**, this is a better option than entering your private key into Xumm.

A regular key will "link" your hardware wallet account to a second XRPL account that will be managed by Xumm. This second XRPL account will not contain any funds, but it will allow you to sign transactions on your hardware wallet account using Xumm. This means you will have full and direct access to your hardware wallet account with Xumm and you will not need your physical hardware wallet to access the account.

If this is what you would like to do, here are the instructions:

{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Is there a better alternative?

Xumm is basically an interface to the XRP Ledger. Understanding how you plan to interact with the XRP Ledger goes a long way to deciding how you should manage your XRPL accounts.

For example, are you interested airdrops? Do you plan on trading on the XRPL DEX? Maybe you would like to collect NFTs or perhaps mint your own NFTs? Do want to play games or gamble in casinos? Purchase gift cards? Create tokens? Escrows?&#x20;

Depending on how you answered some of these questions, you might find that a Xumm card is a better option for you. A Xumm card is an NFC hardware wallet designed specifically into interface with Xumm. It combines the best features of a hardware wallet but also allows you to easily participate in the XRPL ecosystem while still keeping your private keys off line.

#### I created my account during the CasinoCoin swap. Should I consider creating a new XRPL account?

The XRPL accounts that were created during the CasinoCoin swap used a process that some people might find a little difficult to understand. If you ever need to import one of those accounts, there is a special set of instructions to assist you:

[How to recover a CasinoCoin account](https://eminence.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/80000965171-how-to-recover-a-swapped-casinocoin-xumm-account)

As you can see, it can be a bit more complicated than a regular XRPL account. If you are interested in avoiding those complications, it might make sense to consider creating a new account.&#x20;
