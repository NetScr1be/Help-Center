# ...a Xumm Tangem card

### Before you begin...

If you are reading this article, you have probably just received your new Xumm Cards and are eager to get them setup and configured properly.

Most people will want to configure one of the cards as a "backup" card. This is an excellent idea because it ensures that if something were to happen to one of the cards, the other card could be used to access the assets in the account.

In order to configure a backup card, you **must** import **two** cards into Xumm.

That means that you will need to go through the following steps **twice,** once for **each card**.

If you decide to **not** import two cards into Xumm, you will **not** be able to run the Tangem Backup xApp or configure a backup card.

### Importing a the cards and generating new XRP Ledger accounts

From the main screen of Xumm, press the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (2) (3).png>)button then press <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3).png" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

You should see this screen:&#x20;

Choose **Add Tangem card** then hold one of the cards up to the NFC reader on your phone. (Remember, you will need to repeat this step with a second card.)

You should see this message:

Tap **Generate account** then hold the card against the NFC reader on your phone again.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are planning to configure a backup card, you are going to need to **repeat** all of the steps above with a **second card**. If you do not import a second card, you will not be able to configure a backup card.&#x20;
