# ...in Read Only mode

You can import an XRP Ledger account in either of these two modes:\
\
**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

Most people choose to import their accounts with **Full access** but if you are interested in just monitoring an account's activity, you can import in Read only mode.
