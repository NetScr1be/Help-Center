# Should I import my XRPL account into Xumm?

Xumm is an excellent application for making payments on the XRP Ledger, interacting with the XRPL ecosystem and for safely storing your private keys. For many people, moving their existing XRPL accounts over to Xumm makes a lot of sense. Xumm is convenient, easy to use, and very secure, so why not import your account into Xumm to take advantage of all these features...?

### Potential risks...

Anytime you enter your private keys into any software there are potential risks. Spyware, malware, key-logers, screen capture software, viruses, and many more attack vectors can come into play when entering your private keys into your device. So, is there a reason you want move your XRPL account or are you just interested in moving your funds?&#x20;

Consider the following:&#x20;

#### How were your private keys generated?&#x20;

Do you trust the company/service that generated your keys? What was the source of entropy that was used to generate your keys? Has that source been audited? If you are less than 100% sure, it might be time to consider creating a new XRPL account using Xumm.

#### How were your private keys stored?

Can your keys be viewed using your old wallet? Does your old wallet have a way of displaying your private keys? Are your private keys stored on line? (On the internet in a "cloud backup"?) What encryption method was used to store your keys?

While importing private keys into Xumm is certainly easy to do, you should consider why you are taking the risk of importing them into Xumm when there is a much safer option...ðŸ¤”

### Our recommendation

The safest way to protect your funds is to [**create a** **new XRPL account**](../your-first-xrp-ledger-account/how-to-create-an-xrpl-account.md) using Xumm, then move your assets to your new account. There are a number of benefits to doing this:

* Accounts generated by Xumm use a True Random Number Generator to generate the private keys and an exceptionally strong algorithm to encrypt them. Both our TRNG process and our encryption algorithm have been audited and tested hundreds of thousands of times. You can trust that your account secret will not be duplicated by any other software or service.&#x20;
* Xumm only displays the account secret once, when an account is generated. There is no way to access or view it after it is initially displayed. No one, (other than you) will ever see the account secret after the account has been created.
* After a new account is generated, the [**account secret is encrypted**](../../security-and-xumm/all-about-security/upgrading-your-encryption.md) and immediately stored in Xumm. The AES 256-GCM algorithm we use to encrypt it is exceptionally secure.  &#x20;
* If something were to ever "go wrong", it is much easier to narrow down the source of the issue. \

  Which situation is easier to keep track of in your opinion?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Situation 1** - A customer generated an XRPL account on a website several years ago, then imported it into a random wallet they found on the internet. They upgraded their phone and imported the account into a different wallet on the new phone. After a couple of years, they replaced the phone and imported the account into another wallet for a few months before deciding to import it into Xumm.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Situation 2** - A customer got a new phone, installed Xumm, created a new XRPL account.
{% endhint %}

In most cases, situation 2 is much easier to troubleshoot.

### Frequently asked questions

#### I want to import my Ledger Nano account into Xumm.

A  cold wallet such as a Ledger Nano generates and stores your account secret on a USB device. The assumption is that since the device is not directly connected to the internet, it is less vulnerable to potential attack vectors and therefore "safer".

Xumm stores your account secret on your mobile device that is connect to the internet and that your phone will be more vulnerable to potential attack vectors while online.

The truth is, determining how "safe" a particular wallet is does not come down to being online or offline. Every wallet type has its own potential attack vectors and your security habits, preferences  and preparations play a large part in how safe your funds are.&#x20;

The most secure wallet in the world is useless if you voluntarily give your account secret away and the best cold wallet on the planet is not going to help keep your funds safe if the computer that you put in into is compromised.&#x20;

You are welcome to import your XRPL account managed by your Ledger device into Xumm, but please consider what your plans are when it comes to your funds before you do so. How are you planning on interacting with the XRP Ledger? Are you interested airdrops? Trading on the XRPL DEX? NFTs? Gambling? Gift cards? Creating tokens? Escrows?&#x20;
