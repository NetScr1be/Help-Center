# I've lost my account secret!

On the XRP Ledger, the account secret is the "holy grail" of your account.&#x20;

* If you would like to access the funds in an XRP Ledger account, you need to know the account secret.
* If you would like to send funds, or create Trust Lines, or purchase a product or service using XRP, you need to know the account secret.
* If you give your account secret to someone, they now have access to your account and all your funds.

Protecting your account secret and a helping you interact with the XRP Ledger is what Xumm specializes in.&#x20;

...but what happens if you lose your account secret...ðŸ¤”

### What is an account secret?

Have you ever heard the saying,&#x20;

_"Not your keys, not your crypto"_

The account secret is your private key. It is how you get full access your XRP Ledger account.

An account secret comes in three main forms:

* **Secret numbers** - If you created your XRP Ledger account using Xumm, you would have received a set of secret numbers consisting of 8 rows, (A-H), each with 6 digits.&#x20;
*   **Family Seed** - A 29 character string of numbers and letters starting with the letter "s".\


    A typical family seed looks something like this:

    &#x20;          sn3e4r5t6ygtfr5tgy6tr4edse3wq
* **Mnemonic** - A set of 12, 16 or 24 words chosen from the [BIP 39 list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).

Xumm is fully compatible with all three account secret formats.

### An account secret can not be viewed in Xumm

If your XRP Ledger account was created using Xumm, you would have received a set of secret numbers. (8 rows, A-H, each with 6 digits).

Xumm does not have the ability to display or recover your secret numbers. They are only displayed once, when an account is created. After that, there is **no way** to see them again. In fact, Xumm was designed specifically to NOT display them just in case your phone was ever stolen or compromised.

### Only three possible options to access your XRPL account.

Option 1 - You still have&#x20;

#### Option 1 - You still have existing access on your device

If you still have access to your account on your phone **and** you can still sign transactions on your account, you can create a new XRP Ledger account using Xumm:

1\) Press **Settings** then **Accounts**.

2\) Choose **+ Add account** then **Create a new account**

Once you have created a new account, you can activate it with 10 XRP, then move your XRP over to your new account using the **Send** feature on the main page. By creating a new account, you will get a new set of secret numbers which you can use to access your account on your phone. Alternatively you can "rekey" your account, resulting in getting a new XRP Ledger account. You don't have to activate the new account, but it will then become the new key to your existing account.
