# Xumm v0.5.2

* _**The XUMM 0.5.2 update will be available in the Apple App Store & Google Play Store around October 2nd, 2020.**_\*

This (minor) update will contains some improvements and addresses some minor bugs.

Depending on the settings on your phone, you‚Äôll either have to visit the App Store/Play Store and tap the update button, or XUMM will auto-update.

**The next release we will add in-app automatic update checks, so you‚Äôll receive a message in the XUMM app when an update is available üéâ**

**Improved**

* Read Only accounts don‚Äôt show the (confusing) ‚ÄúRequest‚Äù button anymore at the home screen
* Added ‚Äúkeyboard incognito mode‚Äù for Android
* If the ‚ÄòAccount‚Äô field is specified in a Sign Request, that account is now preselected if present as Read/Write account
* Allow importing mnemonics from a QR code
* Add ‚Äúexchange all funds‚Äù button in the ‚ÄúOther assets‚Äù (IOU) exchange screen

**Changed**

* Exchange accounts can not be imported as Read Only account anymore. Added a check for destination tag requirements when importing Read Only accounts, and don‚Äôt allow users to import a Read Only account with mandatory (or likely) destination tag requirement, to prevent confusion.
* iOS FaceID / Fingerprint reader now falls back to OS passphrase/PIN on ‚ÄúEnter Password‚Äù
* Improved QR destination address recognition
* Updated push notification handling, and when an payload is already open (on screen) after scanning a QR, a notification for the same payload will be hidden
* Changed ‚Äúpassphrase‚Äù to ‚Äúpassword‚Äù for XUMM account encryption/decryption (to prevent confusion with mnemonics)

**Fixed**

* Sign Requests (by URL) are now picked up from the clipboard when opening the app from background (minimized) state as well
* When you have an offer on the Decentralized Exchange, when a part of your offer is consumed, XUMM now shows only the affected amounts for the partial fill (instead of the entire consuming offer)
* On rare occasions the wrong currency exchange (IOU) amount was displayed in the transaction history (right amount was exchanged)
* Lots of decimal places are now truncated in the Exchange (IOU) screen
* Fixed app crash on scanning a Coinbase destination QR code
* Fixed Android app crash on empty asset list
