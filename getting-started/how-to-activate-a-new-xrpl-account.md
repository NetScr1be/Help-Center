# Activating an account

In order to be able to hold XRP (or any of the 8300+ tokens issued on the XRP Ledger) in an XRPL account, it must first be activated with a minimum of 10 XRP. The first 10 XRP deposited into an XRPL account is used to meet the reserve requirements &#x20;

This video explains how reserves and fees on the XRP Ledger work.
