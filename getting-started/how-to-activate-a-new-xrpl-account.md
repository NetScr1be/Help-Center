description: How to activate a new XRP Ledger account

# Activating an account

In order to be able to hold XRP (or any of the 8300+ tokens issued on the XRP Ledger) in an XRPL account, it must first be activated with a minimum of 10 XRP. An account can be activated several ways but regardless of how it is activated, the first 10 XRP deposited into an XRPL account is used to meet the reserve requirements so it will not be spendable.

If you're interested, this video explains how reserves and fees on the XRP Ledger work.

After you create a new account in Xumm, you are presented with the following screen:

Here are four ways you can activate an XRP Ledger account:

### Option 1&#x20;

If you are in the Netherlands or the United Kingdom. we offer an On/Off-Ramp service to our Xumm Pro users. You can easily buy (and sell) XRP from our [**On/Off-Ramp xApp**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.onofframp) to activate an account.

For most people, this fast, convenient and secure service will more than meet their needs so if you are interested in learning more about how it works, check out this article:

### **Option 2**

If you are not located in the Netherlands or the UK, we have partnered with several crypto exchanges where you can purchase XRP to activate your account.

**Please** make sure that you **thoroughly research** the crypto exchange that you decide to purchase from. Each exchange has their own rules and fee structures that you should fully understand before signing up. As well, just because we provided a list of exchanges, it does not mean that we support or endorse any of them in any way. It is entirely up to you to decide which crypto exchange you use.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you decide to go with one of the exchanges above, we have provided instructions on how to transfer XRP from them to your XRPL account.
{% endhint %}

### Option 4

You can activate an XRPL account by sending 10 XRP from **another** XRPL account to it.

For example, if you have a friend, family member, co-worker, etc. who has an activated account, you can have **them** activate your account by having them send 10 XRP to it.

Here is how they can send XRP using Xumm:
