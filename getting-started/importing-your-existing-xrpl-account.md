# Importing your account

From the main screen of Xumm, press **Settings** -> **Accounts** -> **+ Add account** -> **Import an existing account**. You should see this screen:

You can import an XRP Ledger in either of these two modes:\
\
**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

Most people choose to import their accounts with **Full access** so they can interact with the XRPL community.

Once you have decided, you will be able to choose which secret type that you have:\

Xumm is compatible with all industry standard account secrets. Choose the appropriate one which applies to your account.

Remember, **no one** should ever ask you for your account secret and you should **never** give it to anyone.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Please take notice of the r-address that is displayed. It should reflect the XRP Ledger account that you are trying to import. If it is correct, press the **Confirm** button.
