# Importing your account

You can import an XRP Ledger in either of these two modes:\
\
**Full access** - Choose this option if you would like to be able to interact with your XRPL account. ie. if you would like to create a Trust Line or send XRP to another account.

**Read only** access - Choose this option if you would like to simply follow the activity of an XRPL account. This option does not allow you to sign transactions on your account.&#x20;

Most people choose to import their accounts with **Full access** so they can interact with the XRPL community.

As well, Xumm is compatible with all industry standard account secrets. Choose the appropriate one which applies to your account.
