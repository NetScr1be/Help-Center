The following table explains the differences.

| Option                                          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (3).png>) | Standard security is a great option your daily spending account. You can sign with your 6 digit passcode or enable biometrics and sign with your face/finger print. |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (2).png>) | Extra security allows you to enter a separate signing password. This is the best option for your long term storage account.                                         |



If you selected **Extra security** you would have created a separate signing password. If you have forgotten that signing password or if it is not working or you would like to change it. This article explains how to do this.



### Step 1 - Remove the account from Xumm

1. Launch Xumm and press **Settings** -> **Accounts** -> then press the **Edit** button beside the account to be removed.
2. Select **Remove from Xumm** then **Yes, I’m Sure**’ on the warning screen.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: This assumes that you have the passcode to remove the account. If you do not have the passcode (or your passcode does not work), you are going to need **uninstall** Xumm, then **reinstall** in Xumm then move on to Step 2 below.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2 - Import your account secret back into Xumm

1. Your account secret will come in the the form of a set of secret numbers / Family seed /Mnemonic. This article will guide you through importing your account with which ever one you have:\
