# Cashing out with Gatehub

### Expanding our partnership with Gatehub

For years, Gatehub has been a strong member of the XRP Ledger community and has worked with us (and many others) to help expand the ecosystem and make it a great place to do business. Recently we have added a feature to make off-ramping crypto a truly quick and easy process by integrating their platform directly through Xumm. This integration makes both on and off-ramping simple and efficient via the Gatehub site.

### Gatehub's issued stable coins

GateHub is a payment gateway platform that allows you to buy, sell, trade and store digital currency. They have also issued over a dozen different tokens on the XRPL, including USDT, USDC, GALA, Flare, SGB, EUR, USD, GBP and several others. All of their issued currencies will be honored by them as the actual asset they represent.  The on/off-ramp feature requires the use of Gatehub's issued coins.

### Getting started

1\) Open and account on Gatehub and activate a new account.  &#x20;

To get started, you need to open an acquire the tokens in the currency you desire.&#x20;

For example, let's say that you have 10 XRP and you could like to convert them into Euros. You would exchange your XRP for Gatehub issued EUR on the XRPL DEX. (There are various ways to do this, the DEX Trade xApp is one of the easiest.
