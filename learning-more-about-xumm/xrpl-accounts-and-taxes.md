# XRPL accounts & taxes

### **Introduction**

Xumm is an [self-custodial wallet](../getting-started-with-xumm/what-is-xumm/understanding-self-custody.md) which allows you to interact with the XRP Ledger. Depending on where you live, some of these interactions can incur tax obligations.

It is your responsibility to investigate and settle these tax obligations with your local government.

### **How do I get a list of taxable transactions so I can file my taxes?**

There are several ways you can export your XRP Ledger account transactions into .CSV format.

1\) Use the **Transaction Exporter** xApp in Xumm.

In Xumm, you should be able to find it by pressing the **x√** button at the bottom of the screen, then selecting **View more xApps**.

If it is not listed there, you scan the QR code with Xumm here:

{% embed url="https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xrpl365.txexporter?launch=true" %}
Transaction Exporter Link
{% endembed %}

### **The .CSV file I exported does not work with my tax software.**



and select the **Transactions** option, then press **Export CSV**.

### **That did not help. It still does not work with my tax software.**

Here are a couple of other things you can try:

* The Transaction Exporter xApp was actually created by one of the XRPL community developers. You might want to try contacting him (Chris) directly and discuss expanding specific compatibility to your preferred tax software. Here's his Twitter account: [@XRPL365](https://twitter.com/xrpl365)

If you are interested in viewing the code for the xApp, you can find it here:

Transaction Exporter
{% endembed %}

* You can contact **Gatehub** and discuss the possibility of having them expand their export capabilities.

You can contact your **tax software provider**. Some companies offer a feature to configure your own manual mapping for alternative imports. They might also consider updating their software to support the .CSV output of either Transaction Exporter or Gatehub.

### **Do you provide a list of tax forms for my country?**

No. Each country has its own tax laws and tax documents. It is just not possible for us to keep up with all of the world’s tax forms.&#x20;

### **What are my options?**

#### **Tax Software**

There are dozens of different tax software applications to choose from on the internet. Do your research and make sure that the one you choose supports your jurisdiction.

#### **Tax Professional (Accountant)**

Depending on local availability, you can hire a tax professional such as an accountant.

#### **File your own taxes**

Each country produces their own tax forms and have their own tax rules. It is up to you to know the rules for your jurisdiction and obtain the correct forms.

### **Which tax software do you recommend?**

Unfortunately, we can not recommend any specific tax software. There are too many companies and applications related to tax preparation for us to stay current with them all.

### **My accountant / tax software needs a list of all of the trades for last year. How can I export the transactions from my XRP Ledger account?**

Most people use the **Transaction Exporter** xApp in Xumm to do this.

In Xumm, you should be able to find it by pressing the **x√** button at the bottom of the screen, then selecting **View more xApps**.

### **The .CSV file I exported does not work with my tax software.**

There are other utilities in the XRP community that will also allow you to export XRP Ledger accounts.

Gatehub has one such utility that may help.

To use it, go here:

{% embed url="https://gatehub.net/explorer" %}
Gatehub Explorer
{% endembed %}

then enter your r-address and select the **Transactions** option, then press **Export CSV**.

#### **Notes:**

* Please keep in mind, the XRPL is a public network. It is the single source of truth, and publicly accessible to **everyone**. The user interface/device used to interact with the XRP Ledger is irrelevant when it comes to fetching transaction information. You can always check your transaction history via a blockchain explorer such as Bithomp, XRPscan, etc.
