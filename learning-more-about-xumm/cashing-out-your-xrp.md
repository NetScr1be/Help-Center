# Cashing out your XRP

If you are interested in converting some of your XRP into fiat, you have several options.

### **Option 1**

If you are in the Netherlands or the United Kingdom. we offer an On/Off-Ramp service to our Xumm Pro users. You can sell XRP from our [**On/Off-Ramp xApp**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.onofframp) and send funds to your bank account. For most people, this fast, convenient and secure service will more than meet their needs so if you are interested in learning more about how it works, check out this article:

* [**All about the Xumm On/Off-Ramp Service**](../xumm-pro-beta/all-about-xumm-pro/features-of-pro/on-off-ramp/all-about-on-off-ramps.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note: You can only off-ramp XRP that you purchased through our service. We do not allow off-ramping of XRP acquired by another means.
{% endhint %}

### Option 2

We have partnered with several exchanges including Banxa, BTCDirect and Guardarian, some of which offer off-ramp services.

Due to the changing regulations in various countries, you'll need to reach out to your preferred exchange and see if they offer off-ramp services to your region.&#x20;

### Option 3

There are several exchanges in the blockchain space where you can convert XRP into fiat. Some of the bigger players include:

* [Gatehub](https://gatehub.net)
* [Bitstamp](https://bitstamp.net)
* [Uphold](https://uphold.com)
* [Kraken](https://kraken.com)
* [Bitrue](https://bitrue.com)
* [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com)

**Please** make sure that you **thoroughly research** the crypto exchange that you decide to go with. Each exchange has their own rules and fee structures that you should fully understand before signing up. As well, just because we provided a list of exchanges, it does not mean that we support or endorse any of them in any way. It is entirely up to you to decide which crypto exchange you use.

### **Frequently asked questions**

#### **What about other XRP Ledger tokens? How to I cash them out?**

Some crypto exchanges support multiple XRP Ledger tokens along with XRP. This should be one of the things that you research before you create an account with them. If you find that your current exchange does not support your desired XRP Ledger token, contact them directly and see if they have any plans to do so in the future.

#### **Can't I just link my Xumm account directly to my bank account?**

If you are located in the Netherlands or the United Kingdom and have signed up for the On/Off-Ramp service through Xumm Pro, then yes, you can link your XRPL account managed by Xumm to your bank account. For everyone else, Xumm does not have the option to do this.

If your bank is interested in adding this feature, we would be happy to discuss it with them. Have them contact us!
