# How to change your Email Address

## Background

In Xumm, we **do not** gather or store any personal information about you or your account. (This includes email). If you are interested, you can view our Privacy police here:

[XRPL Labs Privacy Statement](https://xrpl-labs.com/static/documents/XRPL-Labs-Privacy-Statement-V1.pdf)

Having said this, there are a couple of places where email can be stored...

### **Xumm Pro - Early Access**&#x20;

If you have subscribed to **Xumm Pro**, you have the option to enter an email address if you would like to participate in our beta testing program. You can change your email address by launching Xumm Pro, then choosing **Xumm App early access**.&#x20;

### **Xumm Pro - Onramp / Offramp**&#x20;

If you have an account via our On/Off-Ramp service, you would have entered an email address as part of the on boarding process. As a regulated company, we need to store all information (including email addresses) for compliance reasons, but we can add an additional email address to your file of you like.

Simply open a ticket using the [**Xumm Support xApp**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support?ref=helpcenter) and ask to have your email address for your On/Off-Ramp account updated. (Don't forget to include your new email address in the message.)&#x20;

### Xumm Tangem orders

When you place an order for Xumm Tangem cards, you are asked for your email address during the order process. (We use it to send your "Trace and Trace" information from our shipping company.) Since we usually ship our orders on the same day, there is a very small window where we could actually change your email information. If you contact us in time, we can change it for your order. ðŸ¤ž

As above, open a ticket using the [**Xumm Support xApp**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support?ref=helpcenter) and ask to have your email address for your Xumm Tangem order updated. (Don't forget to include your new email address in the message.)

Per our Privacy policy, your email address (along with any other information you provide us in your order) gets **automatically purged** from our systems shortly after your order is sent.

### **3rd Party xApps**&#x20;

As we continue to expand the XRPL ecosystem, you will notice we will forge more and more partnerships with 3rd party companies such as Banxa, BTC Direct, Gatehub, Stably, etc.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note: We have absolutely **no control** over what information a 3rd party vendor gathers, stores and/or maintains.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

These companies have their own privacy and disclosure policies and each one collects and maintains their own records. In order to change your email address with them, you are going to need to contact them directly.

* [BTC Support](https://support.btcdirect.eu/hc/en-gb/requests/new)
* [Gatehub Support](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/requests/new)
* [Stably Support](https://www.stably.io/contact/)

### **Xumm Developer Portal**&#x20;

If you have signed up for our developer portal, you would have entered your email address.

To get this changed, open a ticket using the [**Xumm Support xApp**](https://xumm.app/detect/xapp:xumm.support?ref=helpcenter) and ask to have your email address for your developer portal account updated.
