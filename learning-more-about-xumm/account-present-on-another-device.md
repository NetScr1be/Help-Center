# Account present on another device

You have just received the following message in Xumm:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Account Present.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Explanation

In most cases, this is an automated message sent when you get a new phone and install Xumm for the first time. Once you import your existing account secret into Xumm, it recognizes that you have a new device which sends the above notification.

If you just imported your account into a new device, there is nothing to worry about.

### Older versions of Xumm

For older versions of Xumm, when an account tries to reach out to our backend servers to interact with the XRP Ledger via an xApp or a sign request, it would trigger an automated push notification and deliver the above message.&#x20;

It did not necessarily mean your account had been added to another device, it just meant that the account had contacted our backend for the first time. Xumm did not know which device it was, only that your r-address tried to connect to the XRPL via our servers.&#x20;

Normally the account had been installed on two devices and one of those devices had just recently tried to use it. (E.g. mobile & second smartphone, or tablet)

### Take this warning seriously!

Our goal here is to warn you that something is possibly wrong with your account and your mobile device. This is not something that just happens. Your entire device could be compromised, (user names, passwords, account information, etc.) and could be at risk.  If there is even a chance of this, it is time to act **immediately**.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Move your funds out of your XRPL account immediately!
{% endhint %}

Move your funds out of your XRP Ledger account  now.

* &#x20;If you have a **Xumm (Tangem) account**, move your funds to this account. The account secret is stored on the card and as long as you have configured it correctly, your account can not be accessed without physical access to your cards. (Primary and Signing)
* If do not have a Xumm (Tangem) account but you have an **exchange** account, it might make sense to move your funds there.&#x20;
* If do not have a Xumm (Tangem) account but you have an **hardware** walle, it might make sense to move your funds there. (Although some hardware wallets are less secure than exchange accounts.

You could consider re-keying your account:\


<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th align="center"></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">How to re-key your XRPL account</td><td></td><td></td><td><a href="../getting-started-with-xumm/how-to-rekey-your-account.md">how-to-rekey-your-account.md</a></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Large rock with Key.jpg">Large rock with Key.jpg</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

then disabling the master keys for your compromised account.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th align="center"></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">How to disable the Master keys on an account</td><td></td><td></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Large rock with Lock.jpg">Large rock with Lock.jpg</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

This will prevent anyone from accessing your compromised account.

Once your account / funds are secure again, try to think of ways your account secret could have been compromised. Have you shared it with someone? Was it stored on a cloud account? On your PC? Mobile device? Have you entered your account secret someplace? A google form? A crypto wallet? Website? Airdrop? If you can't think of anything, there is a good chance your mobile device has been hacked.

At this point we strongly recommend wiping your phone and start reinstalling applications one at a time. Do not restore from backup! Without knowing how your phone was compromised, restoring from backup could be dangerous.\

### Moving forward

We take security VERY seriously.

If you have found yourself in this situation, you should consider the following suggestions moving forward:

* **Xumm (Tangem) cards** - these cards are an excellent way to take the security of your XRPL account to the next level. You can learn how here:\
