# Account present on another device

You have just received the following message in Xumm:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Account Present.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Explanation

In most cases, this is an automated message sent when you get a new phone and install Xumm for the first time. Once you import your existing account secret into Xumm, it recognizes that you have a new device which sends this above notification.

If you just imported your account into a new device, there is nothing to worry about.

### Older versions of Xumm

If you have not recently imported your XRPL into Xumm,&#x20;

For older versions of Xumm, hen an account tries to reach out to our backend servers to interact with the XRPL via an xApp or a sign request, it triggers an automated push notification as a possible warning. The message that you received doesn't necessarily mean an account has been added to another device, it just means that the account is contacting our backend for the first time. We do not know which device it was, only that your r-address tried to connect to the XRPL via our servers. Is it possible that you have this account installed on two devices and just recently tried to use it? E.g. mobile & second smartphone, or tablet? Alternatively there is of course the possibility that someone indeed has access to your secret. Good thing the account has been rekeyed. In that case it would be interesting to try to find out / discover / think of ways the secret could have been compromised, e.g. accidentally shared, cloud account with key compromised, key entered some place (airdrop, name it) in the past. This year March would be when that happened.
