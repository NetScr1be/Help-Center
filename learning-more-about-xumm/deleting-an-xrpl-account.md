# Deleting an XRPL account

### The instructions..

1\) Go to [<mark style="color:blue;">**XRPL Services**</mark>](https://xrpl.services)<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>

2\) Sign in with Xumm using the account you would like to delete

3\) Select the **Account delete** option

4\) Enter the r-address where you would like your funds delivered to.

5\) Sign the transaction.

### Important things to consider

* If you plan to send your remaining funds to a crypto exchange or to another wallet, please make sure that they support the [_accountdelete_](https://xrpl.org/accounts.html#deletion-of-accounts) transaction on the XRPL. Many do not.&#x20;
* The XRP Ledger has a 2 XRP fee to delete an account. (in addition to the regular transaction fee) This means that after you delete your account you should receive about 8 XRP from your 10 XRP base reserve.
* A new account on the XRP Ledger **can not** be activated by the [_accountdelete_](https://xrpl.org/accounts.html#deletion-of-accounts) transaction. If you try to do this, it will be rejected and you will still be charged the 2 XRP fee.&#x20;
* Even after you delete your account, you should **not throw away your account secret**. Someone may send funds to your account in the future and you will need your account secret to access them.







### **I removed my account from Xumm. Why didn't I get the base reserve?**

Removing an account from Xumm is not the same as deleting an account from the XRP Ledger.

(Settings -> Accounts -> Select the _Edit_ button beside the account to be removed -> Press the _Remove from Xumm_ button and confirm on the warning screen.

When an account is removed from Xumm, the account secret is deleted from Xumm, but the account still exists on the XRP Ledger.

&#x20;

If your XRPL account got removed from Xumm in error, it can be imported back into Xumm using the account secret (Secret numbers, Family Seed, Mnemonic) by following the instructions in the following article;

### **I already deleted my XRPL account and sent the funds to my exchange account**

If you already deleted your account and sent the remaining funds to a crypto exchange or wallet that does not support the AccountDelete transaction, you will need to **contact your exchange/wallet** and explain what happened. They will need to locate your funds in their system and deliver them to your exchange account. Unfortunately there is **nothing Xumm Support can do** to help you recover your funds. Only your exchange is capable of delivering your funds to your account.&#x20;

&#x20;

### **Summary**

* **Do not throw away your account secret** (Secret numbers, Family Seed, Mnemonic) after you have deleted your account. You may need it in the future.
* Contact your crypto exchange or destination wallet **before** you delete your account.
