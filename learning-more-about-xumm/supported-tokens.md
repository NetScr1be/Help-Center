# ü™ô Supported tokens

Xumm is exclusively an XRP Ledger wallet. It supports XRP and all of the 8300+ tokens issued on the XRPL.

### **Why doesn‚Äôt Xumm support other blockchains?**

The XRPL is our passion and our specialty and while there are other blockchain technologies that might show promise or potential, we are committed to developing the XRPL ecosystem. Splitting our focus between various blockchains or becoming a ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù wallet does help the XRPL community. &#x20;

### **Do you plan to support other blockchains?**

No. Our focus is the XRP Ledger.

### **‚Ä¶ But I see BTC, ETH, SGB, FLR, etc. tokens on the XRPL. How does that make sense if you don't support those networks?**

Anyone can create a token on the XRP Ledger. (Xumm actually contains an xApp called _**Token Creator**_ to walk you through the process.)

The BTC/ETH/SGB/FLR tokens that were issued on the XRPL are not the same as the native BTC/ETH/SGB/FLR tokens on their respective blockchains.&#x20;

For example, you can not send BTC issued on the XRPL to the Bitcoin network because the Bitcoin network and the XRP Ledger are separate and incompatible networks.&#x20;

People/companies issue tokens on XRPL to enjoy all the benefits of the XRPL but with none of the limitations or issues associated with other blockchains.

### **So can I send ETH to the XRPL?**

No. ETH is the native token on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **What about XLM?**

No. XLM is the native token on the Stellar blockchain. The Stellar blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **SGB?**

No. SGB is the native token on the Songbird blockchain. The Songbird blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **How about XDC?**

No. XDC is the native token on the XinFin blockchain. The XinFin blockchain and the XRPL are separate and incompatible networks.

### **Where can I see a list of the tokens that you support?**

We are not aware of a definitive list of tokens on the XRP Ledger, but you can do a search for most of them here:

### **Which XRPL tokens are you affiliated with and which ones do you endorse?**

_Xumm is **not** affiliated with any token on the XRPL and we **do not** endorse any of them._
