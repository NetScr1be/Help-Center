# Why does Xumm not display value of XRP anymore?

### **Why we changed it..**

Our vision for the future of the XRP Ledger includes both XRP Ledger enthusiasts and a vibrant retail audience.

We think the XRP Ledger is ideally suited for real life payments, so our vision is to expand our ecosystem…. significantly! Not only do we see our user base increasing 10 fold in the coming months, with the onboarding of **retail use cases**, we think XRP will become ‘just another token’ just like fiat stable coins (IOU, backed) and loyalty tokens.

**XRP will always be the native token on the XRPL but over time, it’s dominance will fade as other tokens get more use in the retail environment.**
{% endhint %}

You will see that XRP is still highlighted on the home screen, displayed predominantly at the top of the token list, but with more screen space for filtering/sorting & ready for ecosystem expansion.

### **..but how do I get the value of my XRP now?**

Xumm includes an xApp that displays the values of **all** the tokens in your account called, _**Account Worth**_.

To find it, just launch Xumm and press the “**x√**” button at the bottom of the screen.

You should see _**Account Worth**_ listed in the second row.
