# Account Worth

### **Background**

The Account Worth xApp is designed to display the **total** current value of all of the tokens held in your XRP Ledger account.&#x20;

### **How do I find it?**

### **How does Account Worth calculate the "value" of my tokens?**

For each token in your account, the Account Worth xApp looks at the XRPL DEX and calculates what the liquidation value would be based on the open orders currently on the DEX.  &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Xumm shows the _real_ representation of each asset based on the _current_ DEX liquidity. It shows the amount you can _actually_ trade your tokens for, which is, in case of illiquid pairs, a lot less than the fake price most platforms show.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **What about the base reserve and owner reserves? Are they counted in the total value?**

The Account Worth xApp **includes** the base reserve and owner reserves when calculating the value of your XRP.  The reason for this is that while the reserves are marked as "un-spendable" on the XRPL, they are still **in your account** so they are counted when Account Worth calculates the total value of your XRP. &#x20;
