# Vanity Address

### Overview

A Vanity address is a customized XRP Ledger account address.  The idea behind a Vanity account is to give people the option to personalize their XRP Ledger r-addresses. It is a nice way to make a statement and to own a customized address that will be immortalized on the the XRP Ledger.

The Vanity Address xApp lets you choose from over **400** **billion** pre-mined r-address which start with your name / handle /brand. so you can find the right one for you. Instead of a random account address (starting with a lower case "r") you will have an account address that starts with a lower case r and then a short value that you can choose.

For example, can you guess what our favorite movie is?

... or our favorite band?

This xApp is perfect for helping you customize your public imagine by picking a unique, individual r-address on the XRP Ledger.

### How it works

You may have noticed in the Overview section, we mentioned we have over 400 billion pre-mined accounts. The 'pre-mined' part means that we have tested and stored the private keys for all of those accounts.  If you would like to purchase one of them from us, we can't simply just give you the private keys for your desired account. If we did, how could you trust us to get rid of them after we gave them to you? (Well, we are trust worthy, but still, you can't trust anyone when it comes to your private keys.)

The solution to this lies in the XRP Ledger iteself. One of the&#x20;
