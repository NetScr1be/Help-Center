# Vanity Address

### Overview

A Vanity address is a customized XRP Ledger account address.  The idea behind a Vanity account is to give people the option to personalize their XRP Ledger r-addresses. It is a nice way to make a statement and to own a customized address that will be immortalized on the the XRP Ledger.

The Vanity Address xApp lets you choose from over **400** **billion** different r-address which start with your name / handle /brand. so you can find the right one for you. Instead of a random account address (starting with a lower case "r") you will have an account address that starts with a lower case r and then a short value that you can choose.

For example, can you guess what our favorite movie is?

... or our favorite band?
