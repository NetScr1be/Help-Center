# How to remove a Trust Line

#### How do I remove an empty Trust Line?

When you launch the Token Trasher xApp, you should see a list of the Trust Lines in your account:

In this case we'll remove the Schmeckles Trust Line by pressing the **Remove** button beside it.

Token Trasher will indicate that the Trust Line is empty and eligible to be removed. Press the **Next** button.

Press the **Remove Trustline** button to proceed.

Token Trasher will craft a transaction to remove the Trust Line and display it for your review. Press the **Slide to accept** button and slide to the right. After entering your passcode/password, you should see confirmation that the Trust Line has been removed and the 2 XRP owner reserve has been released to your account! ðŸŽ‰
