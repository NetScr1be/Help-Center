# Token Trasher

The Token Trasher xApp is a utility that allows you to:

* remove unwanted tokens from your XRP Ledger account
* delete unwanted Trust Lines from your XRPL account

This xApp gives you the ability to swap your tokens for XRP (if applicable), send any left over tokens back to the token issuer and remove unwanted Trust Lines.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I select multiple tokens or Trust Lines to be removed at once?

The XRP Ledger does not allow batch signing. This means that you can only remove one Trust Line at a time.

#### Will I get my 2 XRP back for the owner reserve?

Yes. Once your Trust Line has been removed, the 2 XRP held in reserve by the XRPL will be made available for spending.

#### Can I recover my 10 XRP held for the base reserve with this?

No. The Base Reserve is a minimum amount of XRP that is required for each address in the ledger. The only way to recover the base reserve is to delete your account from the XRPL

#### How do I remove an empty Trust Line?

When you launch the Token Trasher xApp, you should see a list of the Trust Lines in your account:

In this case we'll remove the Schmeckles Trust Line by pressing the **Remove** button beside it.

Token Trasher will indicate that the Trust Line is empty and eligible to be removed. Press the **Next** button.

Press the **Remove Trustline** button to proceed.

Token Trasher will craft a transaction to remove the Trust Line and display it for your review. Press the **Slide to accept** button and slide to the right. After entering your passcode/password, you should see confirmation that the Trust Line has been removed and the 2 XRP owner reserve has been released to your account! ðŸŽ‰
