# Understanding fiat currencies

### What is a fiat currency?

Fiat is a type of currency that is not backed by a commodity.  Its value is derived from the trust that it will be accepted by merchants and other people as a means of payment for goods, services and liabilities. All major currencies are fiat currencies including Euros, USD and GBP. They were issued by various governments to be used as legal tender and are regulated by those respective governments.&#x20;

### What is a stablecoin?

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency where the value of the token is pegged to a reference asset.

For example, the Bitstamp exchange has issued a EUR stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. Its value is equal to Euro fiat currency since Bitstamp will accept and redeem the stablecoin and exchange it for Euro fiat upon request.

Another example of a stablecoin would be the BTC to ETH tokens issue on the XRPL by the Gatehub exchange. Their values are pegged to BTC and ETH coins issued on their respective blockchains. Either coin can be redeemed at the Gatehub exchange for BTC/ETH issued on respective networks or they can be convert into various fiat currencies.

### The role of Trust

The value of stablecoin (or any other token issued on the XRPL) is based on the trust of the issuer and the use case of the token.

For example, a company such as Gatehub is a government regulated financial business required to obtain and maintain licenses, legal compliance, auditing and business infrastructure in order to stay in business. They have a proven track record of trust and reliablilty.

The stability of the stablecoin is equivalent to the cost of maintaining the backing reserve and the cost of legal compliance, licenses, auditors, and the business infrastructure required by the regulator.

In this setting, the trust in the custodian of the backing asset is crucial for the stability of the stablecoin's price. If the issuer of the stablecoin does not actually possess the fiat necessary to make exchanges, the stablecoin can quickly lose value and become worthless.

It is typically designated by the issuing government to be [legal tender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal\_tender), and is authorized by government regulation. Since the end of the [Bretton Woods system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton\_Woods\_system) in 1971, the major currencies in the world are fiat money.

Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it.
