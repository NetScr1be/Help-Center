Put simply, Trust Lines are structures in the XRP Ledger designed to allow you to hold tokens.

All assets other than XRP can be represented in the XRP Ledger as **tokens**. Standard tokens are tracked in relationships called [trust lines](https://xrpl.org/trust-lines-and-issuing.html) between accounts. Any account can issue tokens to other recipients who are willing to hold them, but you cannot unilaterally give tokens away to users who don't want them. Tokens can represent any type of value, including "stablecoins" backed by assets that exist outside of the ledger, purely digital tokens created specifically on the XRP Ledger, community credit, and more.
